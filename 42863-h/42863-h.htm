<p class="p4 s08">Thirty articles appearing in this book have been taken from
"The Ladies' Home Journal," to which the author gratefully
acknowledges permission to reprint them.</p>

<p class="center p6 b20">Bright Ideas for Entertaining</p>

<h2><a name="Act_1" id="Act_1"></a>ACTING PROVERBS</h2>

<p>In this game the company may be divided into actors
and spectators. The actors are each given a proverb,
which they are to act alone in pantomime.</p>

<p>The first player may come into the room where the
spectators are waiting, with a sprinkler in one hand and a
cup in the other. He begins sprinkling the flowers, then
he pours water over them, acting the proverb, "It never
rains but it pours."</p>

<p>The second actor also brings a cup of water. He repeatedly
attempts to drink from the cup, which keeps
slipping from his fingers as he brings it near his mouth.
"There's many a slip between the cup and the lip."</p>

<p>The third brings in a purse containing brass buttons,
which he takes out and counts over deliberately. Then
he looks at them closely, and with seeming distrust, finally
flinging them from him in a rage. "All is not gold that
glitters."</p>

<p>The fourth actor appears with a stone, which he rolls all
about the room. Then he examines it critically and
shakes his head dubiously. "A rolling stone gathers no
moss."</p>

<p>The next actor brings in a bundle of hay and tosses it
about with his fork, which he carries for the purpose,
looking up frequently at an imaginary sky. "Make hay
while the sun shines."</p>

<p>This game is more interesting if spectators are furnished
with slips of paper and pencils, that they may write down
their guessing of each proverb when the actor passes from
the room, to be followed by another.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_2" id="Act_2"></a>ADVERTISEMENT ITEMS</h2>

<p>Cut out pictures from advertisements; for instance, from
"Quaker Oats," cut out the Quaker, but nothing that will
tell what it represents. Have a number of them and paste
on plain white paper. Number each ad, and keep a
"key" to them yourself. Furnish paper and pencil to
each guest and have them guess what each picture represents.
The one who guesses the most receives a prize.
Also request every one to write an advertisement on some
article.</p>

<p>Still another form of the game is for each person to
choose his theme for an advertisement, and write it without
naming the article. He will read his advertisement,
and the company must guess what article he is advertising.
A variation of this game is to distribute papers, allowing a
few minutes for examining them, and then let each player
describe some article as nearly as possible in the language of
its printed advertisement, with, of course, such changes as
will serve to divert the company, and give the rest an opportunity
to guess what advertisement he has been reading.
Of course the article should not be named in the course of
the description.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_3" id="Act_3"></a>ALL ABOUT KATE</h2>

<p>This game will furnish amusement at an evening entertainment,
but may also be played after a ladies' luncheon.
The questions, on sheets of paper with spaces allowed for
the answers, are distributed, and fifteen minutes given for
answering them. Each answer is composed of one word
ending with the letters c-a-t-e; for instance: Kate is a
good pleader (advo-cate). When fifteen minutes have
elapsed each player signs her name and passes her paper
to the person on her right. The answers are then read,
and the player having the most correct answers wins a
prize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Questions&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><a name="Act_4" id="Act_4"></a>APPLE SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Cards are sent out with the following:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Come to the Apple Social and see who gets the</i><br />

<i>B&mdash;A&mdash;P</i><br />

<i>L&mdash;A&mdash;P</i><br />

<i>N&mdash;A&mdash;P</i><br />

<i>Social given under the auspices of the</i><br />
<i>East End Connett Y. W. C. T. U.,</i><br />
<i>Monday evening, Sept. 10, 1905</i></p>

<p>Have cards printed with a letter on each one, forming
the names of various apples; for instance, B-A-L-D-W-I-N
and G-R-E-E-N-I-N-G. Have as many letters of one
color made as there are letters in the name of the apple,
and have each group of letters a separate color. These
are passed to the guests, after which each one proceeds to
find the rest of the letters colored like the one he holds,
and when the group is complete, the holders of the letters
proceed to spell out the name of their apple. Each group
then composes an original poem on its apple. The poems
are read to the audience, then the prize of B&mdash;A&mdash;P (big
apple pie) is given to the best poem, L&mdash;A&mdash;P (little apple
pie) to the poorest, and N&mdash;A&mdash;P (no apple pie) to the
group who composes no poem. All kinds of apples are
served for refreshments.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_5" id="Act_5"></a>APRIL FOOL DINNER</h2>

<p>The dinner I shall serve will be plain and substantial,
but it may be as elaborate as one chooses. Following is
the menu:</p>

<table summary="April Menu">
<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Vegetable Soup</td>
<td class="tdc">Pickles</td>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Crackers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Roast Beef</td>
<td class="tdc">Mashed Potatoes</td>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Brown Gravy</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Celery</td>
<td class="tdc">Stewed Peas</td>
<td colspan="2" class="tdc">Tomatoes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Bread</td>
<td class="tdc">Butter</td>
<td class="tdc">Tea</td>
<td class="tdc">Cheese</td>
<td class="tdc">Jelly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td  colspan="5" class="tdc">Cream Pie.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When the dinner is all ready to serve the fun will begin.
Imagine the surprise of the guests when they sit down to
the table, to find the soup served in teacups, the pickles
shining forth from the sugar-bowl and the crackers in a
covered vegetable dish. The roast beef will be cut in
slices and arranged on a silver cake dish, the mashed
potatoes in a dainty glass berry dish, and the gravy in
small individual sauce dishes. The stewed peas will be
served from the water-pitcher in glass tumblers, the celery
on the bread-plate, bread in the salad bowl, butter on the
celery tray, and the tea in soup bowls. The jelly will be
placed on the largest meat platter and served with the
carving-knife, the cheese in the gravy dish, and finally the
pie on large dinner plates.</p>

<p>The sugar will appear in the cracker jar together with
the gravy-ladle, and the cream in the china teapot. The
salt will be found in the mustard cup, the pepper alone
remaining as it should be. Water must necessarily be
served at the dinner, but even this will not be in the
usual manner. I shall serve it in the after dinner coffee
cups.</p>

<p>The soup must be eaten with teaspoons, as the larger
ones will be reserved for the tea.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_6" id="Act_6"></a>APRIL FOOL PARTY</h2>

<p>Invitations may be copied after a dance card of a
"Comus" ball at New Orleans, which represents a large-sized
gilt folly bell with ribbons attached. On arriving,
each guest is given a favor, which may serve also as a score
marker. These are follies' heads, capped and ruffled and
fastened to a stick, which has ribbons wrapped around it.
The colors of these ribbons, not more than two being alike,
determine partners. An attached tiny square of pasteboard,
bearing a painted number, directs to the tables.
Instead of playing one game only, a variety of games are
introduced. At the head, or "Hearts," table is a large-sized
tally-ho horn, tied with a profusion of motley colors.
At the conclusion of the game, the defeated ones blow the
horn and the winners at all the tables are given little brass
bells to tie upon the folly sticks or baubles. The prizes,
both head and booby, are fools' caps of white crepe paper
with huge red rosettes.</p>

<p>The refreshments should be as deceiving as possible.
One hostess at an April first dinner went so far as to serve
the entire course backwards, beginning with ice cream and
ending with soup. Or a very suitable menu may be served
in strange and unusual guise: potato salad arranged as
cream puffs; English walnut shells as receptacles for olives;
sandwiches as slices of cake with nut filling; ice cream as
croquettes, cone-shaped and plentifully sprinkled with
toasted cake-crumbs; cake as sandwiches, with ice cream
between and tied with ribbon; coffee served in bouillon
cups; bonbons served in exact size artificial fruit. Among
the bona-fide dainties may be "April fool" bonbons&mdash;"chocolate
creams" stuffed with cotton, button-moulds
covered with chocolate, and round, yellow pill-boxes filled
with flour, iced to represent small cakes.</p>

<p>After the refreshments the hostess may say that she has
a picture to show which she has just received and which
has given her much pleasure. A curtain is hung before
it, which, when withdrawn with grave ceremony, reveals a
mirror reflecting the expectant faces of the guests, while
on its surface, written with soap, are the words "April
Fool!"</p>

<h2><a name="Act_7" id="Act_7"></a>AUTHORS' CONTEST</h2>

<p>Questions to be answered by giving in each case the
name of a well-known author:</p>

<ol>
<li>A name that means such fiery things, you can't describe
their pains and stings. (Burns.)</li>

<li>What a rough man said to his son, when he wished
him to eat properly. (Chaucer.)</li>

<li>Pilgrims and flatterers have knelt low to kiss him.
(Pope.)</li>

<li>Makes and mends for first-class customers. (Taylor.)</li>

<li>Represents the dwellings of civilized men. (Holmes.)</li>

<li>Is worn on the head. (Hood.)</li>

<li>A chain of hills covering a dark treasure. (Coleridge.)</li>

<li>A brighter and smarter than the other. (Whittier.)</li>

<li>A worker in precious metals. (Goldsmith.)</li>

<li>A vital part of the body. (Hart.)</li>

<li>A disagreeable fellow to have on one's foot.
(Bunyan.)</li>

<li>Meat, what are you doing in the oven? (Browning.)</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Act_8" id="Act_8"></a>AUTHORS' GUESSING GAME</h2>

<ol>
<li>When we leave here we go to seek our what? (Author
of "Elsie Venner.")</li>

<li>What dies only with life? (Author of "Phroso.")</li>

<li>What does a maid's heart crave? (Author of
"Handy Andy.")</li>

<li>What does an angry person often raise? (Author
of "The Christian.")</li>

<li>What should all literary people do? (Author of
"Put Yourself in His Place.")</li>

<li>If a young man would win, what must he do? (Author
of "Wandering Jew.")</li>

<li>How do we dislike to grow? (Authors of "Silence
of Dean Maitland" and "Dawn.")</li>

<li>What would we prefer to be? (Authors of "Book
of Golden Deeds," "Man Without a Country," and
"Under the Greenwood Tree.")</li>

<li>What is a suitable adjective for the national library
building? (Author of "The Heavenly Twins.")</li>

<li>What would we consider the person who answers
correctly all these questions? (Author of "From Post to
Finish.")</li>
</ol>

<p>The answers to the above questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Homes.)</li>

<li>Anthony Hope. (Hope.)</li>

<li>Samuel Lover. (Lover.)</li>

<li>Hall Caine. (Cain.)</li>

<li>Charles Reade. (Read.)</li>

<li>Eugene Sue. (Sue.)</li>

<li>Maxwell Grey and Rider Haggard. (Gray and
haggard.)</li>

<li>Charlotte Yonge, E. E. Hale, Thomas Hardy.
(Young, hale and hardy.)</li>

<li>Sarah Grande. (Grand.)</li>

<li>Hawley Smart. (Smart.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Give the most successful contestant a nicely bound copy
of the latest popular book, and the least successful one a
gaily colored copy of a child's primer, or a gaudy poster
picture.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_9" id="Act_9"></a>AUTHORS' VERBAL GAME</h2>

<p>This is an interesting and instructive game. The players
seat themselves so as to form a ring. An umpire and
a score-keeper are appointed, and each player in turn rises
and announces the name of a well-known book. The one
who first calls out the name of the author of the book
scores a point; the one who has the largest score when the
game ceases is the victor, and may be given a prize. This
game may be varied by the naming of well-known authors,
leaving the titles of books, by these authors, to be supplied.
And it may be played in yet another way. Give each
player a pencil and paper, and instead of calling aloud the
title of a book, as each author is announced, ask the players
to write on a slip of paper the name of the author, the
title of a book by that author, and the name of a character
in the book. Thus:</p>

<ol>
<li>Oliver Goldsmith&mdash;"She Stoops to Conquer," Miss
Hardcastle.</li>

<li>Harriet Beecher Stowe&mdash;"Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
Miss Ophelia.</li>

<li>William Shakespeare&mdash;"Romeo and Juliet," Tybalt.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the game be played in this way the scores will probably
be close.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_10" id="Act_10"></a>"B" SOCIABLE</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>This can be changed to suit any other letter and the invitations
may be worded as desired. Have tiny boxes,
barrels, bags, and baskets filled with candy, fruit, or nuts,
for souvenirs.</p>

<p>If it is desired to make money, a price may be placed
upon each article of food, and the souvenirs may be offered
for sale.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_11" id="Act_11"></a>BARN PARTY</h2>

<p class="center">
    <i>Miss Gertrude S. Derr</i><br />
<i>requests the pleasure of your company</i><br />
<i>at a Barn Party,</i><br />
<i>Monday evening, August 12, 1905,</i><br />
<i>on Water Road,</i><br />
<i>Shortsville, New York</i></p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap"><b>Arranging for the Party</b></span></p>

<p>To insure the success of such a party, a moonlight night
should be selected. The barn chosen should be large, the
floor space ample, and the decorations lavish. They may
consist of green boughs, vines and goldenrod, and a number
of American flags.</p>

<p>The two large opposite doors should be thrown wide
open for free circulation of air. The floor should then be
cleared, swept and washed. High up over one door a
large flag may be draped, and wires stretched across from
beam to beam, away from direct draughts, upon which
Japanese lanterns may be hung, care being taken that none
are allowed to come into contact with the bunting in case
of one's taking fire. Chairs should also be provided, and a
rope stretched across one side of the open space, on the
farther side of which place a table. On this table place a
large bowl of soapsuds, into which a spoonful of glycerine
has been put, and by its side place half as many pipes as
there are to be guests. Prepare half as many cards also as
there are to be guests, and write across the full length of
each card the name of an agricultural implement, as hay-rake,
hay-cutter, pitchfork, hoe, spade, scythe, sickle,
mower, plow, reaper, binder, seeder. On the reverse side
each card should be numbered at the top, and a question
written concerning the implement named on it; besides
this the number and another query should be written upon
the lower half. Questions like the following will answer:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>No. 1. What is the true mission of a harrow?</li>

<li>No. 1. Can you tell a harrowing tale?</li>

<li>No. 2. What is a hoe used for?</li>

<li>No. 2. What is a good receipt for hoe cake?</li>
</ul>

<p>The cards should then be cut in halves, and the matching
of them will determine partners for the bubble blowing
contest. The answering of the questions will also afford
much amusement throughout the evening.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_12" id="Act_12"></a>BASEBALL PARTY</h2>

<p>A novel party was recently given by a mother to celebrate
the sixteenth birthday of her only son. She had
been rather envious of her friends in their happiness of
planning many luncheons and other pretty affairs for their
girls, consequently she entered heart and soul into this
party for her boy, sparing neither expense nor trouble to
make it a success. It was announced as "A Baseball
Party," and by enlisting the services of a niece, who was
very enthusiastic over the national game, she was able to
carry out the idea.</p>

<p>Eight of her son's friends were invited, who, with the
boy himself, made the required "nine." Luncheon was
first served. Before going into the dining-room each boy
was assigned a place on the "team," and found his place
at the table accordingly. In place of name-cards were
tiny "fans" bearing the words "catcher," "pitcher,"
etc., and, of course, each guest knew just where to sit.</p>

<p>The menu-cards were booklets with the words "Official
Score" written on the covers. The menu consisted of
nine courses, or "innings," as they were more appropriately
termed. It was written in language unintelligible to
the average feminine mind, but the boys guessed what
many of the viands were amid much merriment. The
reading of the menu, and the conjectures as to what the
courses would be, broke up any stiffness that might have
resulted from nine boys lunching together. It read as
follows&mdash;only in the original the interpretations were, of
course, left out:</p>

<table summary="Baseball Party">

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Everybody scores</td>
<td class="tdr">(The passing of favors)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The favors consisted of a ticket for a ball game to be
played on the local grounds that afternoon for each boy,
and a tin horn with which to "root," as the boys expressed
it.</p>

<p>As soon as the luncheon was finished the nine boys departed
in great glee for the ball grounds, relieving the
hostess of the responsibility of further entertaining them.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_13" id="Act_13"></a>BEAN BAGS</h2>

<p>Make twelve or fifteen bags, six inches square, of bed-ticking,
and loosely fill them with beans which have been
washed and dried to remove all dust.</p>

<p>Appoint two leaders, who choose sides, arranging the
sides in lines facing each other, with a small table at each
end of each line.</p>

<p>The bean bags being equally divided, each leader deposits
his share upon the table nearest him. Then, at a
given signal, seizing one bag at a time with one hand, with
the other he starts it down the line, each player passing it
to the next until all the bags reach the last, who drops
them upon the table at his end of the line. When all the
bags have reached this table, the last player, seizing each
in turn, sends them back up the line to the leader, who
drops them upon his table. Whichever side first succeeds
in passing all the bags down the line and back, wins the
round. It takes five rounds to make a game, so that three
out of five must be successful for the winning side.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_14" id="Act_14"></a>BEAN SOCIABLE</h2>

<p><i>Have you ever "bean" to a "bean" sociable? If not

<h2><a name="Act_16" id="Act_16"></a>BIBLE CONTEST</h2>

<p>The game of Bible Contest cards can be played very
profitably and is very instructive. It can be found in
any book store in large cities or can be had of the United
Society of Christian Endeavor, Boston, Mass. The cost
is very little. Or the cards may be written out as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give the first and last words of the Bible.</li>

<li>Whose three daughters were the fairest in all the
land?</li>

<li>How old was Methuselah when he died?</li>

<li>Who was called "a ready scribe in the law of
Moses"?</li>

<li>Give the names of the three persons who were put
in the fiery furnace.</li>

<li>Who was the author of the expression, "What hath
God wrought?"</li>

<li>With how many men did Gideon conquer the
Midianites?</li>

<li>Who was Moses' brother?</li>

<li>Who went down into a pit on a snowy day and
slew a lion?</li>

<li>Who said "The harvest is past, the summer is
ended, and we are not saved"?</li>

<li>Who was the mother of Samuel?</li>

<li>Who commanded the gates of Jerusalem to be
closed on the Sabbath?</li>

<li>Whose flock was Moses tending when he saw the
burning bush?</li>

<li>What city was saved from famine by lepers?</li>

<li>Who waxed fat and kicked?</li>
</ol>
<p>Name.<span class="i4">No.</span><span class="i2">No.</span></p>

<p>Have the cards distributed; then on a given signal have
the answers written out; as fast as finished have them
handed in to be examined by the committee who afterward
returns them. The first blank for number is for the
order in which the cards are handed in, and the second
for the order of correctness of the answers.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_17" id="Act_17"></a>BIBLE EVENING</h2>

<p>Here is a well-known alphabet of Scripture proper
names, which may be utilized at a social by ranking the
members on two sides, and reading these lines one at a
time, in the same way that a spelling-bee is carried on:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>A was a monarch who reigned in the East (Esth. 1: 1).</li>

<li>B was a Chaldee who made a great feast (Dan. 5: 1-4).</li>

<li>C was veracious, when others told lies (Num. 13:
30-33).</li>

<li>D was a woman, heroic and wise (Judg. 4: 4-14).</li>

<li>E was a refuge, where David spared Saul (1 Sam.
24: 1-7).</li>

<li>F was a Roman, accuser of Paul (Acts 26: 24).</li>

<li>G was a garden, a favorite resort (John 18: 1, 2; Matt.
26: 36).</li>

<li>H was a city where David held court (2 Sam. 2: 11).</li>

<li>I was a mocker, a very bad boy (Gen. 16: 16).</li>

<li>J was a city, preferred as a joy (Ps. 137: 6).</li>

<li>K was a father, whose son was quite tall (1 Sam.
9: 1, 2).</li>

<li>L was a proud one, who had a great fall (Isa. 14: 12).</li>

<li>M was a nephew, whose uncle was good (Col. 4: 10;
Acts 11: 24).</li>

<li>N was a city, long hid where it stood (Zeph. 2: 13).</li>

<li>O was a servant, acknowledged a brother (Philem. 16).</li>

<li>P was a Christian greeting another (2 Tim. 1: 1, 2).</li>

<li>R was a damsel who knew a man's voice (Acts 12:
13, 14).</li>

<li>S was a sovereign who made a bad choice (1 Kings
11: 4-11).</li>

<li>T was a seaport, where preaching was long (Acts
20: 6, 7).</li>

<li>U was a teamster, struck dead for his wrong (2 Sam.
6: 7).</li>

<li>V was a cast-off, and never restored (Esth. 1: 19).</li>

<li>Z was a ruin with sorrow deplored (Ps. 137: 1).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Act_18" id="Act_18"></a>BIBLE NAMES</h2>

<p>Choose sides as in a spelling match, and let the leader
of the first side give the first syllable of the name of some
Bible character. The leader of the opposite side will then
complete the name, if he can. Failing this, his side loses
a member, selected by the leader of the opposite side.
And so the contest goes on down the line, first one side
and then the other proposing the first syllable of some
name.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_19" id="Act_19"></a>BIBLE READINGS</h2>

<p>A good way to promote study of the Bible is a "Bible
oratorical contest," in which four or five contestants recite,
or give as readings, selections from the Bible. If well done,
it will prove most entertaining, and many people will go
home surprised that the Bible is such an interesting
book.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_20" id="Act_20"></a>BIRD CARNIVAL</h2>

<p>The invitations to the carnival had various kinds of
birds painted upon them, and each guest was requested to
come representing the kind of bird designated on his or her
invitation. There were two invitations of each kind, one
sent to a lady and one to a gentleman, that there might be
a "pair" of each variety of bird. As the guests arrived,
each was labeled with the name of the bird he or she represented,
and in this way it was easy for them to find
their "mates" for refreshments. The house was profusely
trimmed with flowers, vines, and leaves (many of them
artificial, borrowed from a near-by store); every available
space was covered, the banisters, the mantel posts, the door-
and window-frames, the archways, etc., and even the
walls of the dining-room were hung with the trailing vines,
so that the place looked like a veritable woodland dell.
All the stuffed birds that could be secured were perched
here and there among the vines and branches, some on
nests with their mates beside them; a large owl was placed
high in one corner, and in a cozy nook in another corner
was the nest of a meadow lark, with father and mother
birds teaching their young ones to fly. Besides this canaries
in cages were distributed throughout the house, lending
their music to the general effect. Bird eggs of every
description were also used to help decorate. In the centre
of the dining table a nest was arranged, containing a mother
bird and her little ones, while suspended from the gas jet
by gayly colored ribbons and reaching almost to the nest,
were many prettily decorated egg shells, the contents having
been "blown" from them by means of small holes
made in each end. Twenty-five rhymes about birds were
pinned about the rooms, the guests being required to answer
them. Following are given the rhymes and their answers.
The hostess kept the "key" and read the correct
list at the close of the contest, when a canary bird in a
cage was given as first prize and a stuffed bird as second
to the most successful contestants. At the close of the contest,
the roll was called and each "bird" present responded
by an appropriate quotation, these having been previously
distributed by the hostess.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Bird Pie</span></p>

<p>After refreshments were served, an enormous "bird pie"
was placed upon the table and each guest was given a
slice. This pie was made of pie crust, and was filled with
tiny trifles wrapped in tissue paper, most of them representing
birds, eggs, nests, etc. On the top of the pie twenty-four
little birds cut out of black paper were perched by
means of pins stuck through their feet. Also pinned to
the pie was this verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>When this pie is opened</p>
<p class="i1">The birds begin to sing?</p>
<p>That is where you all are fooled;</p>
<p class="i1">We won't do such a thing!</p>

<h2><a name="Act_24" id="Act_24"></a>BOX PARTY</h2>

<p>A box party can be made very enjoyable if every one
enters into the contest.</p>

<p>Each lady should pack a box with lunch for two and at
the party the boxes can be auctioneered off to the highest
bidder.</p>

<p>Or, if there is any objection to that, the ladies' names
can be placed on slips of paper and the papers put into a
hat and passed to the gentlemen; the slip each draws contains
the name of the one with whom he is to eat refreshments.</p>

<p>If this party is to make money for some society the wisest
way will be to sell the boxes.</p>

<p>The same plan may also be followed for a Sunday-school
or other picnic.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_25" id="Act_25"></a>CAKE SALE</h2>

<p>Probably the description of a cake sale that was held for
the benefit of a library fund may not come amiss to show
just how attractive and successful such an affair can be
made. The principal feature of this sale was the cake contest&mdash;a
game, with cake prizes. This game was devised
to take the place of raffling, which was voted out of date.
It was played by groups of ten, who on paying a fee were
given printed lists of questions to be answered. Each list
had to be signed with the player's name and put in the
"post-office" by a certain time in the evening, and later the
names of the prize-winners in each group were announced.
To promote sociability and fun, a lady's and a gentleman's
first prize, and a lady's and a gentleman's booby were
given in each group. The prizes were cakes, iced and
fancifully decorated with colored candies, and each cake
was put on a wooden plate, covered with a frill of crepe
paper. The boobies were ginger and sugar horsecakes.
Below is the list of questions and answers used in the contest,
which may be lengthened or shortened at will:</p>

<p>Which cake did the society woman buy? Reception.
The schoolgirl? Composition. The grocer? Sugar. The
artist? Exhibition. The farmer? Harvest. The mean
man? Sponge. The tramp? Loaf. The minister?
Scripture. The milliner? Feather. The maiden aunt?
Tea. The dairyman? Cream. The champion? Cup.
The pretty girls? Ribbon. The jockey? Horse. The
shoemaker? The last. The sculptor? Marble. The
small boys? Snowballs. The gossip? Spice. The Bryan
man? Silver. The young man for his sweetheart? Angel.
The fond mamma for her daughter? Wedding. The
candidate for office? Election. The politician? Plum.</p>

<p>Then there were cakes for sale, whole or cut. Small
tables were placed at one end of the hall; and here cake
was served with tea, coffee or chocolate. The cake booths
were attractively decorated with crepe paper and flags.
Posters announced the specialties and prices at each.
Watermelon cakes were the novelty at one booth; apple
lemon cakes at another; a plentiful supply of cookies,
dominoes, horsecakes, gingerbread dolls, and little patty
pan cakes, containing a prize to attract the patronage of
the children, at another. Little china dolls, marbles, china
dogs, cats, vases, etc., were put in the dough when the
little pans were filled. These china toys were not injured
by the baking and delighted the children beyond measure.</p>

<hr class="l30" />

<p>At a cake sale recently held for the benefit of a church,
a novel feature was introduced in the sale of "Scripture
cake."</p>

<p>The cakes were baked in several different sizes, and sold
for from twenty-five cents to one dollar. With each cake
sold was given a copy of the recipe by which it was made,
which was as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>Scripture Cake</b></span></p>

<h2><a name="Act_26" id="Act_26"></a>CAKE WALK (Novel kind)</h2>

<p>I hope this will not shock any of my readers, and I don't
think it will after it is read. It can be held in a church or
Sunday school room without any qualms of conscience on
any one's part. Have each one come to represent a cake.
For instance, sponge cake can be represented by having
sponges all over the body; batter cake, by young man
wearing baseball suit of clothes and carrying bat; cup
cake, by wearing cups around the neck and waist; fruit
cake, by carrying baskets of different kinds of small fruits;
angel cake, by wearing pictures of angels on the dress and
hair; one, two, three, four cake, by wearing the figures 1,
2, 3, 4 pinned on dress or coat; cooky, by wearing chef's
cap and apron and a large letter E making that person
cook-e; plain cake, by dressing very plainly; orange cake,
by carrying orange in each hand; nut cake, by carrying
nuts. Any other cake can be represented by carrying
out the same idea. All should keep moving around so
that the people can see what each one represents. A
prize of a cake can be given to the one guessing the greatest
number of cakes correctly. Refreshments should consist
of every variety of cake served with cocoa or coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_27" id="Act_27"></a>CALICO CARNIVAL</h2>

<p>The society who gave it had the oddly written announcement
given below published in the local papers a week in
advance. They also used it as a handbill:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Calico Carnival</span></p>

<p>"Consider yourself cordially invited to be present at the
correctly constructed and considerately combined calico
carnival to be held at &mdash;&mdash; Hall, Friday night, February
&mdash;, 1905, admission fifteen cents.</p>

<p>"Conspicuous courses served in confused compactness:
One conglomerated compound circle; one cup communicative
cordial (containing no chickory), or one cup of
Chinese cheer, or one cup of choice churned cream; one
cider cured cucumber; and one cup of cold comfort.</p>

<p>"Rules and regulations: All ladies to wear calico
gowns, also requested to bring half a pound of carefully
cut carpet rags each. All gentlemen to wear calico ties
and requested to bring thimbles.</p>

<p>"Fines will be imposed for the following: Any lady
who fails to wear a calico gown, ten cents; any lady who
fails to bring half a pound of carefully cut carpet rags, ten
cents; any gentleman who fails to wear a calico tie, twenty-five
cents; any gentleman who fails to bring a thimble, five
cents.</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;There will be for sale, cheap, cunning calico
conveniences that will be a constant comfort.</p>

<p>"N. B.&mdash;Any person who sits in a corner and refuses to
converse will be fined five cents.</p>

<p>"The sale of calico conveniences will begin at &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, everybody came. The fines and admissions
alone would have paid the ladies for the trouble of getting
up the carnival.</p>

<p>The "conspicuous courses" consisted of cake; coffee,
tea, or buttermilk; pickles; and ice water.</p>

<p>Among the "calico conveniences" which sold readily
were the following articles: Dusting caps, button bags and
bags of every description, chair cushions, aprons with bibs
and aprons without, and, in fact, everything that could
possibly be manufactured from calico.</p>

<p>The carpet rags were given to the gentlemen to sew.
An inexpensive prize was given to the one who first finished
his task.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_28" id="Act_28"></a>CAN FACTORY</h2>

<p>The words to be guessed all begin with <span class="smcap">CAN</span>&mdash;the definitions

<h2><a name="Act_30" id="Act_30"></a>CHESTNUT SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>First procure a good quantity of chestnuts. Plain and
roasted chestnuts may be sold at one table. They should
be measured into pint and half-pint paper bags, ready for
customers.</p>

<p>A second table will be needed for bonbons. An excellent
taffy is made by stirring chopped chestnuts into
plain molasses candy when ready to take from the fire.
Caramels are improved by adding chopped chestnuts.
Chopped chestnuts and figs added to crisp sugar candy
make a good sweet-meat. Shelled chestnuts are glazed by
dipping in hot sugar candy. A variety of candies can be
made from this receipt: One pound of confectioners'
sugar, well beaten white of one egg, one tablespoonful of
cold water, one teaspoonful of vanilla. Mix well together
and mould on a board. Mix it with chopped
chestnuts and cut into cubes. Small balls of the cream
can be rolled between the hands, and a whole chestnut
(shelled) pressed on one side. The cream can be colored
with fruit coloring and different shapes can be made from
this. Shelled chestnuts dipped in melted sweet chocolate
are delicious.</p>

<p>Old "chestnuts" are prepared by putting old jokes in
chestnut shells and glueing them together. These will
cause much fun and merriment for the young. Have a
large bowl of water with three chestnuts in it and let each
guest be given two toothpicks to try to get the chestnuts
out of the water with the toothpicks, without getting the
fingers wet.</p>

<p class="center p2">PROGRAM FOR CHESTNUT SOCIABLE</p>

<p>Have some one recite "Curfew Shall Not Ring To-night"
and "Over the Hills to the Poor House." Let
some one sing "The Old Oaken Bucket" and "Annie
Laurie." Have some one read "The Sword of Bunker
Hill" and "Bingen on the Rhine." Any variety of
entertainment can be gotten up with a little forethought.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_31" id="Act_31"></a>CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY FLOWERS</h2>

<p>Each month has a flower or plant appropriated to it, and
to each a meaning is attached. The list is as follows:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>January&mdash;Snowdrop.</li>
<li>February&mdash;Primrose.</li>
<li>March&mdash;Violet.</li>
<li>April&mdash;Daisy.</li>
<li>May&mdash;Hawthorn.</li>
<li>June&mdash;Wild rose.</li>
<li>July&mdash;Lily.</li>
<li>August&mdash;Poppy.</li>
<li>September&mdash;Morning-glory.</li>
<li>October&mdash;Hop.</li>
<li>November&mdash;Chrysanthemum.</li>
<li>December&mdash;Holly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The snowdrop means consolation; the primrose, the
freshness of early youth; the violet, modesty; the daisy,
innocence; the hawthorn, hope; the wild rose, simplicity;
the lily, purity; the poppy, the consolation of sleep; the
morning-glory, contentment; hops, joy; the chrysanthemum,
cheerfulness; the holly, foresight and protection.</p>

<p>The morning-glory is such a perishable flower that it is
almost useless for the purpose of decoration, consequently
it will be wise to substitute goldenrod, symbolizing stateliness,
in its stead.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_32" id="Act_32"></a>CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY PARTIES</h2>

<p>A birthday is an important event in a child's life, and
should not pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>A small party for little children is usually more enjoyable
and more easily managed than a large one. With
many mothers it is the custom to invite as many little
guests as correspond to the number of years of the child
whose birthday is celebrated.</p>

<p>Make the table look as attractive as possible with flowers.
A pretty arrangement for a fifth birthday is to have a
round table, with vines, or a rope of wild flowers or leaves,
arranged over it to represent a five-pointed star. The
sandwiches, confectionery, etc., may be placed within the
star, the birthday cake in the centre, and the five guests
seated between the points of decoration.</p>

<p>For a sixth birthday, a pretty arrangement would be a
six-pointed star, the points to be made with the long fronds
of the sword fern. So many people have pots of these
ferns growing in their houses, and the foliage is so abundant,
that some of the older fronds of the plant may well
be spared. The money myrtle is also effective for this
decoration, and, in summer, the little partridge vine with
its red berries, to be found in every woods, makes very
pretty trimming. The cake should be in the centre, and
the other viands placed within the star, the children's
plates between the points. Either a round or square table
may be used as preferred.</p>

<p>For an eighth birthday, a square table may be used with
walls of Troy decoration arranged for two children at a side.
If the birthday comes in December, a rope of evergreen is
appropriate and very effective for this decoration, with
branches of holly or other red berries at the corners, the
"goodies" to be placed in the centre.</p>

<p>For a tenth birthday, quite a long table is needed, and a
pretty arrangement of vines in scallops, with a small bunch
of flowers at each point may be carried out, the viands being
placed in the centre, and a child's plate in each one of
the scallops.</p>

<p>In all these arrangements due prominence must be given
to the birthday cake, the principal feature of the feast. It
is placed usually in the centre, is round, decorated with
frosting, and as many tiny candles as the child is years old.
These are placed in toy candlesticks, made so that they can
easily be thrust into the frosting, and the candles are
lighted just before the children go to the table. The candlesticks
may be purchased at a toy store. It is an excellent
idea to place some little souvenir in the cake for each
child, tiny china dogs, cats and goats being desirable for
this purpose.</p>

<p>A candy house will also make a novel and attractive centrepiece
for a children's party table. Build a log house of
red and white sticks of candy, and form the roof of cocoanut
strips. For a rail fence use sticks of chocolate candy
or straws and make the grass of spun candy.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_33" id="Act_33"></a>CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS PARTY</h2>

<p>There in the library stood the most perfect snow-man.
He wore a fur cap and long white whiskers, and on the
floor behind him lay his pack, which had just slipped off
his back. He held a doll on one arm, and over the other
was hung a line of tiny sleigh-bells. This snow Santa Claus
was made of cotton batting, but he looked exactly like the
snow-man in the yard, and the children greeted him with
cries of delight. Two sticks, wrapped in many thicknesses
of cotton to form the legs, had been nailed to a
block of wood to make a foundation for this snow-man;
the other parts of the body were made like snowballs and
sewed in their proper places.</p>

<p>Each child was allowed to throw a soft rubber ball twice
in attempting to hit the string of bells which Santa held.
Those who were successful were told to take some article
out of the pack as a reward. Fancy cornucopias and
small boxes filled with nuts and candy were found by the
lucky contestants.</p>

<p>The children were then asked to guess the number of
berries on a large piece of mistletoe which hung from one
of the chandeliers. The one guessing nearest the correct
number received a stick-pin bearing a tiny enameled spray
of mistletoe.</p>

<p>Then came old-fashioned romping games, after which a
Christmas carol was sung and the children marched in to
supper. A star-shaped table had been arranged for the
occasion. In its centre was a small but handsomely
decorated tree. The refreshments consisted of turkey
sandwiches, cocoa, lemon jelly with whipped cream,
sponge cake, bonbons and nuts. The sponge cake was
baked in small star-shaped pans, and ornamented with red
and white icing.</p>

<p>In the parlor an immense snowball was hung from the
chandelier. This had been made by fastening four barrel-hoops
together so as to form a round frame, over which
was sewed white cambric. Then the ball was covered
with batting and sprinkled with diamond dust. A slit was
made in one side, and each child put in his hand and drew
out some article wrapped in tissue paper. These proved
to be dolls, balls, and toys of all sorts. Some drew out
tiny boxes inside of which were slips of paper with directions
like these: "Look under the divan and you will find
a steam-engine," "Look beside the radiator and you will
find a doll's kitchen," etc.</p>

<p>In the dressing-room they were softly pelted with a mysterious
shower of snowballs, which they endeavored to
catch. The balls were packages of marshmallows wound
loosely with white crepe paper.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_34" id="Act_34"></a>CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS TABLEAUX</h2>

<p>Build a cave-shaped box on a raised platform, drape inside
and out with white muslin, fasten evergreen boughs
about the entrance and at the back, draping all of these
with loose tufts of cotton like new-fallen snow, and sprinkling
them with mica. Sprays of red berries can be introduced
with splendid effect. White covered steps must
lead up to the cave, about the mouth of which may be
spread white fur rugs. Let the candles be fastened
plentifully around the cave, but have the rest of the room
very dimly lighted. In the cave arrange the gifts, wrapped
and properly marked, being careful to have one for each
person present. Dress a pretty, golden-haired little girl as
a fairy, with wings and spangles to enter the cave and
bring out the gifts, and a couple of little boys as imps or
brownies to deliver them. Low music should be played in
some concealed corner, with now and again a song or
chorus by a band of children dressed as fairies. The presentation
of the tableaux may either precede or follow the
distribution of the gifts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boy Blue.</span>&mdash;A little boy in a blue suit stands on a pile
of hay, side to the audience, with a tin trumpet to his
lips. Piano music, "Little Boy Blue." If the song is
sung softly, it is an addition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bo Peep.</span>&mdash;A little girl in a white gown, with a shepherd's
crook, in pursuit of a woolly lamb on rollers, being
drawn across the stage by an invisible string. She stands
as if she were running, with one foot out behind her,
while the lamb disappears and some one reads the rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep</p>
<p>And can't tell where to find them;</p>
<p>Let them alone and they'll come home</p>
<p>And bring their tails behind them."</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Muffet.</span>&mdash;A little girl sits on Boy Blue's pile of
hay, eating something from a saucer. A small boy steals
up behind her, with an artificial spider on a string attached
to a pole, which he slowly lowers into her plate. Appropriate
music is played, and Miss Muffet screams as the
curtain is drawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cinderella.</span>&mdash;A little girl, with torn calico dress and
unkempt hair, stands at the right of the stage, her hands
clasped and uplifted, smiling in wonder. Before her
stands a very small boy in a smart military suit, with a
white cotton wig on his head, indicating the coach in
which she is to go to the ball. The coach may be a
pumpkin hollowed into the proper shape, and drawn by a
small dog harnessed to it with ribbons, or a go-cart, or
baby carriage, drawn by a larger dog. Some one behind
the scenes plays a waltz very softly. Plenty of red fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Jack Horner.</span>&mdash;For this a boy with a mischievous
face should be chosen. He sits on the floor in
the centre of the stage, with a huge pan covered with
white paper between his feet. Some one behind the
scenes reads the nursery rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Little Jack Horner</p>
<p>Sat in a corner,</p>
<p class="i1">Eating a Christmas pie;</p>
<p>He put in his thumb</p>
<p>And pulled out a plum,</p>
<p class="i1">And said: "What a great boy am I!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Little Jack Horner, of course, suits the action to the
words, pulling a prune, date or raisin out of a hole in the
paper pasted over the pan. He puts it in his mouth as
the curtain is drawn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Following the Flag.</span>&mdash;In one corner of the stage a
tent is erected&mdash;a white sheet over a centre pole. All the
small boys who have military suits, drums, trumpets and
muskets, stand about, and one in the very front holds the
flag. In front of the tent, on a pile of hay, lies another
small boy, in a military suit, with his eyes closed, and behind
him stands a little girl in a big white apron, with the
symbol of the red cross on her left arm. Music behind
the scenes is either "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground,"
or "The Star Spangled Banner," and all the rest of the
red fire is ignited. When it dies down, the curtain is
drawn, the lights are turned up, and the pianist plays
"Home, Sweet Home."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_35" id="Act_35"></a>CHILDREN'S EASTER PARTY</h2>

<p>The little guests when they arrive will be made happy
by giving them small baskets to hunt for the eggs which
the mother has a few days before blown and colored and
hidden all over the house.</p>

<p>In a room where there is a hardwood floor have little
yellow chicks arranged as tenpins at one end and give the
children each an egg and let them roll the eggs and see
how many chicks they can knock down. While they are
doing this take some of the eggs they have found, run
ribbon through them and suspend in different lengths from
a chandelier.</p>

<p>Among these suspended "eggshells" have Easter eggs
filled with good things. You can buy the eggs, and fill
some of them with candy and some with peanuts; put
tiny dolls in some and small toys in others, so that no two
eggs will be filled alike. Then blindfold one child at a
time; give him a small cane and let him make one strike
and see what he can bring down. It is a good idea to
spread a sheet under the chandelier on the floor, so that
the shells can be gathered up quickly. Then announce
refreshments.</p>

<p>In the centre of the supper-table upon a mound of
smilax place a large rabbit on his haunches, and in his
front paws an Easter egg. From this mound to each plate
run a different-colored piece of ribbon, with a card attached.
Upon the card have the child's name who sits at
that place.</p>

<p>At one end of the table have an Easter cake with lily
decorations, and at the other end place something that
looks like a large white frosted cake, with one little downy
chick in the centre, and five or six in a row around the
edge. This is not a cake but a baking-pan turned upside
down, covered with white paper and frosted white.</p>

<p>Have all the refreshments upon the table&mdash;thin slices of
bread and butter, sandwiches, nuts, tiny cups of chocolate,
cake and ice cream.</p>

<p>After all have finished eating and are ready to leave the
table the little ones may be told that at the count of three
they are to pull their ribbons, first removing Bunny from
his nest to avoid breaking any dishes. Then every child
will find attached to the ribbon an egg, the color of his or
her ribbon, filled with candy or a small gift of some sort.</p>

<p>These eggs, a little yellow chick, and the baskets may
be given to the children to carry home.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Easter Salad</span></p>

<p>A delicious and most attractive salad for Easter may be
made by building a nest of narrow strips of cold boiled
potatoes upon a few very crisp lettuce leaves. Fill the
nest with eggs made of cream cheese rolled in grated yellow
cheese. Serve on individual plates with a well-made
mayonnaise dressing, and plain crackers, or thin slices of
brown bread and butter.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Easter Gelatine</span></p>

<p>Pour gelatine flavored with unfermented grape juice into
egg shells and set them upon the ice. When the jelly
seems to be firm remove the shells, and you will have as
many pretty clear violet eggs as you have had shells. Arrange
them around a mould of Bavarian cream, and serve.
Gelatine flavored with chocolate, orange or cranberry
juice would make equally pretty eggs, and probably please
the children better than the violet ones.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Easter Baskets of Dessert</span></p>

<p>Little baskets of puff paste were filled with yellow
"<i>eggs</i>" made from a rich custard which had been thickened
with cornstarch, cooked until stiff and poured into
egg-shaped moulds. When cold the custard "eggs" were
removed from the moulds, placed in the pastry baskets and
surrounded with whipped cream, which was dotted with
white grapes cut in half and the seeds removed. The
effect was very pretty and the dessert delighted the eyes of
the guests as well as their palates.</p>

<p>This dessert might be utilized for any other occasion by
pouring the custard into different-shaped moulds and dotting
the whipped cream with candied cherries or fresh
berries.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_36" id="Act_36"></a>CHILDREN'S SOUVENIRS</h2>

<p>Souvenirs at a children's party should be very inexpensive.
Candy put up in some pretty form is the most suitable
thing that can be given. The dainty Japanese confections
that may be purchased at any large store where
Oriental goods are sold are novelties, and always please the
little people.</p>

<p>It is always a great pleasure to children to have something
to take home with them from a party, and very
inexpensive souvenirs will give happiness quite out of proportion
to their value. Japanese trifles make pretty gifts,
little boxes, bags or baskets filled with candy. Tiny kites
are appropriate for boys, and fans for girls. Japanese
dolls may be dressed with the lower part of the skirt prolonged
into a bag and filled with candy. Only candy of
the simplest kind should be used.</p>

<p>Candy boxes in various fanciful forms, as banjos, drums,
tambourines, watering-pots, pails, caps, helmets, fish, etc.,
may be purchased from any dealer in such wares. They
are also made in the shape of birds and animals, as peacocks,
canaries, turtles, alligators and elephants. Hollow
oranges and apples, fruit baskets, with realistic cherries,
grapes, etc., on top, and room for candy underneath, are
very pretty. If these are thought too expensive ornamented
cornucopias to hold bonbons may be procured at
various prices, beginning at fifteen cents a dozen. Mottoes
containing paper hats and caps may be procured as cheaply
as ten cents a dozen, and a package of these, holding as
many as the child is years old, tied with the birthday
color, makes a dainty souvenir. Little cradles filled with
candy and ornamented with bows are also appropriate
gifts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Souvenir Pudding.</span>&mdash;A common wash-tub, filled
with bran or sawdust, will make a nice pudding for a
child's party by putting the souvenirs in a layer in the
bottom of the tub, then a layer of sawdust, then more
presents, and so on until the tub is filled. Have a large
wooden spoon and let each child make a dive with the
spoon until he gets one souvenir. This will please the
little ones.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_37" id="Act_37"></a>CHILDREN'S SWEET PEA TEA</h2>

<p>The invitations to this tea read like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2"><i>Prepare yourself for a Sweet Pea Tea,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>The 'bus will call for you at three.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>July 19th.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>In one corner of the card a sweet pea was painted in
water colors. These cards were sent by mail. Of course,
the recipients of these invitations had no idea where the
party was to be, and waited in great expectation for the
appointed day. Two 'bus men were engaged and furnished
with a list of the invited, and at three o'clock, or as nearly
that hour as possible, called for the guests, and after a
short and misleading drive arrived at last at their destination.</p>

<p>After being received by the hostess, the guests were given
cards and pencils and ranged around a long table in the
centre of the room, on which were strewn leaves of many
kinds of plants. Five minutes were given for guessing the
plants to which the leaves belonged. At the expiration of
that time, the cards were taken (after names had been
signed), and a prize given to the best guesser.</p>

<p>The guests were then seated, and cards on which was
the following list of questions passed around: 1. What
field flower is something to eat and a dish we drink from?
2. What did the soldier say when he bade his sweetheart
good-bye? 3. The name of what flower is used every
day in a slang expression? 4. The name of what flower
did Johnny's mother use when she told him to rise? 5.
What hotel in New York city bears the name of a flower?
6. What flower is most popular in April? 7. The name
of what flower means comfort? 8. What is the saddest
flower?</p>

<p>The answers are: 1. Buttercup. 2. Forget-me-not.
3. Daisy. 4. Johnny-jump-up. 5. Aster. 6. Easter
lily. 7. Heartsease. 8. Bleeding-heart.</p>

<p>The prize for this was a book of flowers and verses.</p>

<p>A basket of sweet peas was then passed to the girls, a
different color of flower for each one. A similar basket
was passed to the boys, and the search for partners began.
The boy with the yellow sweet pea became the partner of
the girl with the yellow flower. The boy with the white
found the girl with the white, etc. The table was strewn
with sweet peas, a cut-glass bowl of sweet peas graced the
centre, and on each napkin was pinned a small bunch of
the flowers.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_38" id="Act_38"></a>CHILDREN'S TOM THUMB ENTERTAINMENT</h2>

<p>For a children's party try the following device: Place
four chairs in one end of the room and throw over them a
large blanket or shawl to cover them completely down to
the floor. Have some one double up his hands into fists,
and on the back of the hands, with a piece of charcoal,
paint eyes, nose and mouth, and on one of them paint a
moustache. Put dolls' dresses on the arms, reaching down
to the elbows. Put hoods or caps on the hands. Let the
person thus prepared crawl in between the chairs, and resting
the elbows on the floor, hold his forearms perpendicular,
so that the backs of the hands will be facing the audience.
All the rest of the person's body should be concealed,
of course, under the shawl. Call these two little
people Tom Thumb and his wife. Have some one for
their manager, who should stand in front of the chairs and
tell them what to do. The manager should explain why
Tom has a dress on. He can have them perform a number
of clever tricks, such as bowing to the audience, kissing
each other, pushing each other, etc. They can answer
questions in a little, fine voice, or say, "How do you
do?"</p>

<p>It will be found that this entertainment will please the
little folks immensely.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_39" id="Act_39"></a>CHILDREN'S VALENTINE PARTY</h2>

<p>From sheets of pink and creamy tinted paper, cut the
requisite number of hearts&mdash;two for each invitation&mdash;and
form into envelopes by pasting a pink heart and a creamy
tinted one together along the edges, except at the large
end, which must be left open to hold the written invitation.
On a slightly smaller heart of thinner paper, write the following
doggerel:</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From half-past six to half-past nine,</p>
<p>I pray you to be guest of mine.</p>
<p>With Valentine, their patron Saint,</p>
<p>Sure all good lovers are acquaint;</p>
<p>So in his honor kindly spend</p>
<p>A pleasant evening with a friend."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Slip this in the envelope formed by the two hearts, having
first glued to the indentation at the larger end of the
small heart a loop of baby ribbon by which to pull it out.
On the white side of the envelope write the name and address;
on the pink side, an older sister may draw cunning
little Cupids, or hearts transfixed with little arrows.</p>

<p>Cut from pink paper as many hearts as there are to be
boys, but no two of these hearts must be of the same size;
cut from gilt paper the same number of hearts, one for
each girl, matching in size those cut from the pink paper.</p>

<p>When the guests arrive, give each boy a pink and each
girl a gilt heart. When a boy finds the girl who holds a
gilt heart matching in size his pink one, they are partners
for the evening. In this search all formality will have
worn off.</p>

<p>Cupid's Darts will pass a jolly half hour. Make a large
heart of several layers of pink tissue paper, and fill it
loosely with bonbons; encase this in a slightly larger
heart of open-meshed bobinet; hang on the wall on one
side of the room by two loops sewed to the large, upper
part of the heart. Provide a toy bow and arrow, and let
each child in turn shoot at the heart. The arrows will remain
sticking in the lace and paper, and the one whose
arrow comes nearest the centre receives the first prize&mdash;a
heart-shaped box of candy.</p>

<p>Also provide small heart-shaped boxes filled with candies
for each child to take home.</p>

<p>For refreshments, make sandwiches from heart-shaped
pieces of bread cut with a cake cutter; bake the cakes in
heart-shaped tins, and have the ices frozen in the same
design.</p>

<p>As red and pink are the proper colors for decoration on
this day, it will be a pretty idea to have the lemonade colored
pink with fruit juice.</p>

<p>Pretty favors can be made from crepe tissue-paper.
Flowers, bonbon boxes, handkerchief-cases, and many
another trifle, will please the young folks, more especially
if they are the work of their little hostess's own hands.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_40" id="Act_40"></a>CHINESE PARTY</h2>

<p>Invitations should read as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Come to the Chinese Tea Party</i><br />
<i>and help eat</i><br />
<i>Rice and Rats</i><br />
<i>Prepared and Served by Chinese Girls</i><br />
<i>at &mdash;&mdash; Church</i><br />
<i>Monday Evening, Jan. 4th.</i></p>

<p>You can stimulate interest in the heathen wonderfully
by inviting them to come, with all their bag and baggage,
and pay your society a visit. Have booths in the room
representing the countries in which the church is doing
missionary work. Let the attendants be costumed like the
natives, and all the appointments of the booths suggest the
life of the countries represented. When curiosity is thus
piqued, information about these mission lands may be
circulated by the help of questions on cards to be passed
around. Write the questions in black ink, and underneath,
in red ink, the answer to one of the other questions. It
will require a pretty lively interchange of cards for each
one to find the answer to his question.</p>

<p>The committee should try to make this evening as
attractive as possible, and if it can be arranged all the
members should appear in Chinese costume. In the centre
of the church room, fit up a booth, covered with a large
Chinese umbrella, and around it place small tables on
which to serve refreshments. This can be made to look
like a Chinese garden. Rice and rats can be served as
follows: Boil rice until rather stiff and turn it into cups
to cool. After ready to serve turn upside down in dishes
and serve each dish with a <i>candy rat</i> on top. The rice
should be served with cream and sugar. Also have tea
and wafers. A small fee can be charged for refreshments
to go to missionary purposes. Of course no one but the
committee should know what the "rice and rats" is to be,
as it would spoil the fun. A nice idea would be to give
chopsticks as souvenirs.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_41" id="Act_41"></a>CHRISTMAS COSTUME PARTY</h2>

<p>The invitations for a Christmas party of this sort should
be enclosed in white envelopes decorated with holly and
should read as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Master &mdash;&mdash;, as "Winter,"</i><br />
<i>and Miss &mdash;&mdash;, as "Christmas,"</i><br />
<i>will be glad to receive the "Months"</i><br />
<i>on Thursday evening,</i><br />
<i>December the twenty-fourth.</i></p>

<p>In the lower left-hand corner of each, above the address,
should be indicated the character which the little guest is
to represent, as, for instance: "Please represent July."
Have the little host and hostess represent "Winter" and
"Christmas."</p>

<p>When the children arrive let them find a throne built of
dry-goods boxes, covered with Canton flannel with the
fuzzy side out, well sprinkled with diamond dust and tufts
of cotton, and above the throne a canopy made of evergreen
boughs. Dip some of the boughs first in a weak
solution of gum-arabic and then in flour, and sprinkle
them with diamond dust; hang others in alum water until
crystals form over the foliage.</p>

<p>Dress the little host in a suit of white cambric well
bespangled with crystal beads and glass pendants. Let
him wear white slippers and stockings, and over one
shoulder a white shawl covered with artificial frost. On
his head place a jaunty white beaver hat decorated with a
long white plume.</p>

<p>The little hostess should wear a white dress of soft, fluffy
material, trimmed with holly and mistletoe, and red stockings
and slippers.</p>

<p>Seated upon the throne, beside one another, they should
receive their guests, who should appear in the characters
indicated upon their invitations. After all the children
have been welcomed let them form in line, with "Winter"
and "Christmas" leading, and march up-stairs and down
to the music of piano and violin.</p>

<p>The children might then be shown some views of Bethlehem
and the Christ-Child and told or read a Christmas
story. Just before going-home time some "grown-up"
person, dressed to represent Santa Claus, might come in
and deposit his pack in the dining-room and distribute
some little gifts. Then some simple refreshments should
be served before the children go home.</p>

</table>

<p>Select for your color scheme red and green. Set the
dining-table in the centre of the room directly under the
chandelier. To the latter fasten a large bunch of holly
with plenty of red berries, and make garlands of evergreen
to reach from the chandelier to the four corners of the
table, fastening each one to the tablecloth with a bow of red
ribbon. Have plenty of holly berries in the garlands of
evergreen. If holly is dipped in a strong solution of alum
water and dried in the sun, it will have the effect of being
frosted. Have a red carnation with a sprig of green laid
at each plate. Red and green paper napkins should be
used. Have pretty side dishes of red and green things,
such as red apples, red and green grapes, and all kinds of
red and green bonbons. The first column of the menu as
given should be printed or written and laid at each plate,
for the guests to study while the courses are being served.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_43" id="Act_43"></a>CHRISTMAS UMBRELLA GAME</h2>

<p>Take a large umbrella&mdash;an old one will do&mdash;wind the
handle with bright yellow ribbon and line the body with
red percaline as near the color of holly berries as possible.
Be sure to shape the lining so that it will not sag. Cover
the outside with green percaline and finish the top with
sprigs of holly and a bow of red and green ribbon. Trim
the edge of the umbrella with a row of tiny bells and wind
the ribs with crepe or tissue paper the same color as the
lining; do this the last thing so that it will not come undone.</p>

<p>Select small appropriate gifts for the young guests; conceal
them within dainty wrappings and tie them with
ribbon to the ribs of the umbrella. When ready for the
game let the children form a circle and choose one of their
number to stand in the centre and hold the umbrella.
The children may then dance around singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Merrily 'round this Christmas ring,</p>
<p>Dancing gayly as we sing.</p>
<p>What would this umbrella bring</p>
<p>If we changed to hippetty-hop</p>
<p>And our hostess called out 'stop'?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>When singing "hippetty-hop" let the children hop
around instead of dancing, and when the hostess calls out
"stop" the child with the umbrella raises it over his head
and the present which sways longest belongs to him. He
unties it, and as he does so he hands the umbrella to
another child, whose place he takes in the circle, and so
on until all the children have had a chance to hold the
umbrella and receive one of the gifts which hang from it.</p>

<p>After the game the umbrella may be given to the child
who receives the largest number of votes as a souvenir of
the evening.</p>

<p>If one does not wish the trouble of trimming an umbrella
as described above, a Japanese umbrella may be
purchased for a small sum, and will be equally appropriate.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_44" id="Act_44"></a>CHURCH BAZAAR SUGGESTIONS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">For an Orange Grove.</span>&mdash;Evergreen trees should be
procured and placed about the hall to make it resemble a
grove. The oranges may be made of a wad of cotton, inclosing
a trinket, covered with orange-colored tissue paper.
Hang them on the trees and let each purchaser select the
one he wants, paying a nominal sum for it.</p>

<p>Other attractions may be a booth where real oranges
may be bought; a well from which orangeade is dispensed;
a booth for articles of fancy-work made in shades of orange,
and one for orange-flavored cakes and candies.</p>

<p>The booths should, of course, be draped in orange color,
relieved by touches of white, the attendants' costumes being
of the same shade. Orange blossoms, made of tissue
paper, will add daintiness to the decorations.</p>

<p class="p2">An unoccupied house is a most convenient place to hold
a fair. Each room may be devoted to some special attraction;
one for the supper, one for the evening's entertainment,
one for the fortune-teller, and so on. This idea
is admirable for an affair of the nations, devoting one room
to each country and its characteristics.</p>

<p class="p2">Seats should be provided in the grove where the visitors
may be refreshed with orange ice, or orange gelatine and
cake at a moderate price.</p>

<p>If there is a small room adjoining the hall in which the
fair is held it may be fitted up to represent a tropical scene.
This would be the place to sell rubber plants, palms, ferns,
etc. Long clusters of bananas hung amid the foliage will
make the scene more realistic.</p>

<p class="p2">A tulip bed is one of the prettiest ways of hiding surprise
packages. A portion of the floor should be marked
off in a square and enclosed with boards one foot high,
painted green. Fill this bed with sawdust and plant paper
tulips in all colors. Have a package tied to the end of
each tulip, making the flower stand firm when planted.
Each purchaser pulls up any flower he chooses.</p>

<p class="p2">Although brown seems a sombre color for a fair booth,
it may really be used most effectively. Have the booth
made oblong with a counter across the front and have each
end covered with brown crepe paper with frilled edges;
have also a brown curtain below the counter hanging to
the floor. Have the roof, and the posts supporting it,
covered with the russet leaves of the chestnut-tree, while
around the roof a fringe of chestnut burrs is hung. At
one end of the booth serve hot chocolate with whipped
cream; at the other have all kinds of nuts on sale; and in
front have a display of chocolate and nut cakes and
candies. In arranging for any sort of church entertainment
remember that elaborate accessories are not of so
much importance as the display of cleverness in the carrying
out of the ideas which form the basis of the entertainment.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_45" id="Act_45"></a>COBWEB SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>First, wind strings all over the house before the arrival
of the company. Suspend a rope diagonally across one
corner of the room, over which the ends of the strings can
hang, each one numbered: Numbers are to be given each
one of the guests, and each is to hunt the string that has
his number on it. A sheet can be hung across this end of
the room hiding everything from view until time for winding.
Have some games ready to play for the amusement
of guests until all have arrived. As soon as all the company
gathers, the sheet can be removed and all commence
hunting their numbers at once. They are told to go wherever
the string leads, but they may not succeed as the
strings should be through keyholes, under beds, out of
doors, around the house, in at the windows, and every
place where they can be put.</p>

<p>Plenty of fun can be had if every one enters into the
game and keeps it up until finished. Bananas and cake
can be served at this sociable or any other light refreshments
desired.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_47" id="Act_47"></a>COOK BOOK SALE</h2>

<p>Every lady in the church was asked to make, from sheets
of brown wrapping paper, ten paper books of uniform
size, four and one-half by six inches, sewing them to confine
the leaves. The paper was two cents a sheet, and
five sheets would make the ten books.</p>

<p>In each book, clear and explicit written directions for
ten of the best miscellaneous recipes that she used in
cooking were to be contributed by each one, the same
recipes to be in the ten books furnished, and signed by
the one contributing them.</p>

<p>The ten recipes included one soup, one salad, one
made-over dish, one cake recipe, one cooky recipe, two
muffin or gem recipes, and three dessert recipes.</p>

<p>One week was allowed for this work, then the books
were sent where the sale was to take place. There were
five hundred books in all, fifty ladies having responded to
the request.</p>

<p>In the meantime, invitations had been sent to the members
of the other two churches in the town, and to the
summer visitors, and the vestry-rooms were crowded the
evening of the sale.</p>

<p>The books were offered for sale at five cents each, and
in less than an hour all were sold, those contributed by
housekeepers famous for their cooking being in great demand,
while all were of more or less interest in a town
where every one is well known.</p>

<p>After the sale of the recipes, the real sport of the entertainment
began. Each lady who contributed recipes also
brought a sample of cake made from the cake recipe she
had given. These samples were of all sizes, wrapped in
waxed paper and tagged with the maker's name. They
were auctioned off without being undone, the name attached
to the tag being read by the auctioneer, and much
merriment was occasioned by the witty, bright way in
which he drew attention not only to the cake, but to the
one who made it.</p>

<p>If desired, such an auction sale may be held without the
cook book sale preceding, whole and cut cakes, cookies,
doughnuts, etc, being used. As the cakes are wrapped and
no one knows what he is buying, much amusement results.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_48" id="Act_48"></a>COOKY SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Cut paper into pieces the shape and size of a cooky.
Write a proverb on each one, then cut each paper cooky
into two parts, each in a different manner, so that no two
cookies will be cut alike. One set of halves is to be given
to the ladies, and the other to the gentlemen. Each
person present then proceeds to match the half cooky he
has; when found, the proverb should read correctly. The
couple who match halves eat refreshments together. It is
very nice to have some one play a march on the piano while
the matched partners form in line two by two and march
to the supper-room. For refreshments serve all kinds,
shapes, and sizes of cookies with coffee or lemonade.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_49" id="Act_49"></a>CORN-HUSKING BEE</h2>

<p>Late in October, when the corn has matured and been
stacked in the barn, the following informal invitations may
be sent out to all the neighboring young people:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>You are cordially invited</i><br />
<i>to a Corn Husking to be held in</i><br />
<i>Martin Mattice's Barn</i><br />
<i>On the evening of October the thirty-first</i><br />
<i>at eight o'clock.</i></p>

<p>Previous to the evening mentioned the ears of corn are
stripped from the stalks and formed into two huge piles
upon the barn floor. Lanterns should be hung here and
there upon the beams to give the necessary light, and stools
provided for the workers. The company, on arrival, is divided
equally, one half being assigned to one pile, the
other half to pile number two, and the contest begins, each
division striving to finish its pile first. The husks must be
entirely removed from each ear, and whoever first discloses
to view a red ear is considered especially fortunate, as the
first red ear shown is supposed to bring good luck to its
possessor.</p>

<p>After all the ears have been husked the winner of the red
ear is escorted in state to the house, where a warm fire
(always an open one, if possible) and a supper are waiting.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Corn Supper</span></p>

<p>Decorate the walls of the room in which the supper is to
be served with as much green as can be procured at this
season of the year. Procure a dozen pumpkins, remove
the pulp, cutting a hole at the top of the shell; cut also
four stars in the sides of each pumpkin, cover with light
yellow paper and place candles inside. These lanterns,
being set in various convenient spots about the room and
lighted just before the supper is served, shed a corn-colored
glow over the room. In the centre of the table arrange a
vase filled with any late autumn yellow flowers&mdash;dahlias,
chrysanthemums or marigolds; place candles at each end
of the table screened by yellow crepe paper shades. The
refreshments may consist of egg and lemon-butter sandwiches,
cornbread, chicken salad, sponge cake, gold cake,
lemon ice cream and lemon water ice, cup custards, honey
in the comb, lemonade and coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_50" id="Act_50"></a>DUTCH PARTY</h2>

<p>For decorations: Holland's national colors, blue and
red; Dutch flags; tulips; crepe paper in Delft designs,
etc. Instead of tally cards each guest may be furnished a
little wooden shoe on a Delft-blue ribbon. Tiny pretzels
are slipped on the ribbon for games won, the shoe keeping
them from slipping off at the other end. Large wooden
shoes may be used for bonbons and nuts at the tables.
For prizes: handsome steins and pipes, a pair of burnt
wood Holland shoes, Delft plaques, Dutch pictures,
novelties decorated with quaint Dutch figures, a poster of
Queen Wilhelmina, etc.</p>

<p>The supper table may have for its centrepiece a large
blue stein with red tulips tumbling out of it. Delft china
and paper napkins are appropriate, and a <i>menu</i> of Dutch
dishes:</p>

<h2><a name="Act_51" id="Act_51"></a>EASTER EGG HUNT</h2>

<p>An Easter egg hunt will furnish plenty of amusement for
an Easter party.</p>

<p>The nests are made of paper moss. In them are placed
eggs of different varieties, some genuine hard boiled eggs,
some of china or wood and some of candy. The wooden
eggs should contain tiny ducks or chickens. The nests are
hidden in every nook and corner of the house. The guests
are then bidden to go nest hunting, and a half hour is
given for the hunt. Each guest is given a little fancy
basket in which to gather his eggs. The one securing the
greatest number of eggs is given a prize of a large fancy egg.</p>

<p>The baskets and eggs may be retained as souvenirs.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_52" id="Act_52"></a>EASTER LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>Of course, silver and glassware must be sparkling, and
the white cloth spotless, or, if one wishes, luncheon scarfs
and mats or doilies are equally popular, and a highly
polished table is a bit less formal than the regular dinner
cloth. A centrepiece of gold cloth or of any yellow silken
material is effective&mdash;the edges may be quickly overcast
by heavy rope silk in long and short stitch. A bunch of
Easter lily sprays in a bowl or gold and white vase crown
the whole. If one can arrange to have the china gold and
white it is very pretty; but every hostess must consult her
own china store and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Napkins stiffly folded at each place can hold an artificial
lily, which carries in its heart a tiny candy box.
These lilies can be bought at some caterer's or made at
home very easily. Stiff wire&mdash;yet not so stiff as not to
bend in any desired shape&mdash;can form the skeleton. The
stem is made of five wires woven together, green paper being
twisted over them and at the top; each separate wire
is bent out to form a foundation for each white petal, made
of white crepe paper, easily shaped and pasted in place.
A little practice will show the amateur that this is not at
all difficult. A pill box covered with gold paper can be
pressed down in the heart of the lily, the top being
covered with stamens made of gold paper shredded and
twisted.</p>

<p>Lilies of the same type, only larger with larger boxes
having no covers, can form the bonbon boxes. These
must be even more conventional, as they have no stems,
resting directly on the table. The menu should be simple.</p>

<p>When the luncheon is over and the guests have left the
dining-room for the drawing-room, a new edition of the
old cobweb game makes merry fun and is arranged as follows:
A huge flower-pot is placed on the centre of the
table, in which are planted some artificial lilies to carry
out the idea, and under the flower-pot are gathered the
ends of many strings, each one of which must be appropriated
by a guest. These strings cross and intercross about
furniture and corners of course, and give opportunities for
many tte--ttes. Here and there some little verses may
be tied if it is wished to add fun to the quest.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Do not faint, oh, maid, I beg,</p>
<p>You shall find a golden &mdash;&mdash;"</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Gather roses while you may;</p>
<p>Gather them&mdash;the livelong day."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And many another nonsense couplet to suit the company
and occasion.</p>

<p>At the end of each string must be found a candy Easter
egg, or a hollow egg containing some little trinket.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_53" id="Act_53"></a>EASTER SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Have printed programs sent out with the following announcement
(any name can be substituted for the East End
Connett Y):</p>

<p class="center">
<i>An eggs-ellent plan has been adopted by</i><br />
<i>the East End Connett Y, to eggs-haust the</i><br />
<i>eggs-pence of sending a delegate to the State Convention.</i><br />
<i>We shall hold an</i> <span class="smcap">Egg Social</span>.<br />
<i>The eggs-pence of admission is eggs-actly ten cents.</i><br />
<i>We mean to have an eggs-ellent time.</i><br />
<i>You are urged to eggs-ert yourself to come and</i><br />
<i>eggs-amine for yourself.</i><br />
<i>You can eggs-pect to have lots of fun at small eggs-pence.</i><br />
<i>An eggs-ellent committee will wait upon you.</i><br />
<i> Plenty of eggs will be served.</i><br />
<i>Eggs-it at your pleasure.</i><br />
<i>N. B.&mdash;Plenty of Easter Egg novelties will be sold.</i></p>

<p>A fruit-stand covered with moss and twigs, and arranged
to represent a nest filled with eggs and placed upon a bed
of moss should form the central decoration for the table.
Around the nest four large rabbit bonbonnires should be
placed, with pieces of baby ribbon of all colors fastened to
their forepaws and running out to or below the edge of the
table, each ribbon being strung with eggs. Between the
four large rabbits four smaller ones should peer out from
under the nest between the ribbons.</p>

<p>Provide each person present with a dime, lead-pencil, and
sheet of paper, upon which the following list is printed.</p>

<p>Find upon the dime the following articles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fruit of a tropical tree. (date)</li>
<li>What the Siamese twins were. (United)</li>
<li>What a lazy man seldom gets. (ahead)</li>
<li>The division of a country. (states)</li>
<li>The cradle of liberty. (America)</li>
<li>Something a schoolboy makes. (figures)</li>
<li>An instrument to catch sound. (ear)</li>
<li>The number a miser takes care of. (one)</li>
<li>What makes the forest green. (foliage)</li>
<li>Something a bootblack likes to give. (shine)</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course the answers are not printed, but are kept by
the committee for reference. A prize of one dime can be
given the one with the most correct answers. Any kind
of Easter novelties can be sold for a dime. For refreshments
serve eggs in every form, with bread and butter and
coffee, for one dime.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_54" id="Act_54"></a>FAIRIES' GARDEN</h2>

<p>A clever scheme for a church fair is the "Fairies' Garden,"
which is nothing more than the old grab-bag in a
new dress. One seen recently was set up near a booth
trimmed with evergreens, with a fence made of "cat-tails,"
planted about four inches apart, enclosing it in front. To
this the people who were present flocked, and were free,
on the payment of a small sum, to pull a flower or vegetable
as they should see fit. Within and at the back of the
inclosure was a trellis made of wire netting with the largest
holes procurable, covered with vines, among which nestled
pink paper roses. In each rose a small present was hidden
from view.</p>

<p>Then there was a "pond," made of a tin boiler banked
with stones and moss, and filled with water, on which
floated water lilies and leaves. To each lily was tied a
weighted present, such as the water could not injure.</p>

<p>A bed of real goldenrod planted in a box of sawdust,
with the presents tied to the stems of the flowers and buried
in the sawdust, completed the flower garden.</p>

<p>The vegetable bed fully repaid for all the time and
trouble spent upon it. It was an enclosure of four boards,
filled with sawdust, the vegetables being made of paper
and filled with cotton and the presents. After the vegetables
and flowers were planted the beds were covered with moss.</p>

<p>A few signs added to the effect, such as "Great South-Sea
Bubble" for the cabbage bed, and "Please do not
pull the cats' tails. By order of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals," for the cat-tail fence.</p>

<p>Carrots, beets, onions and cabbages answered the purpose
well, being of convenient shapes and very easily made. The
carrots were made on a cornucopia of stiff brown paper, in
which the present was put, and then the cornucopia was covered
with plain carrot-colored tissue paper, closed at the top,
painted to imitate the creases in a carrot, and ornamented with
a small tuft of leaves cut from green tissue paper. The beets
were stuffed with cotton, in which the present was concealed,
and then covered with the proper colored tissue
paper. The onion bulbs were covered with crinkled cream-white
tissue paper, and the tops were made of stiff white
paper spills, or lamp-lighters, covered with dark green tissue
paper. The cabbages were of pale green and yellow&mdash;almost
cream color&mdash;crinkled tissue paper, wound around
the central ball of cotton; the paper was cut and pulled
out in the shape of leaves, or twisted to form the stalk.</p>

<p>There were four little girls dressed as "flower fairies,"
who kept the garden in order, and helped in many ways,
looking very effective in their costumes of a "morning-glory,"
a "daffy-down-dilly," a yellow and white "daisy,"
and a "wild rose."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_55" id="Act_55"></a>FEAST OF SEVEN TABLES</h2>

<p>This feast if well planned and carried out is most pleasing
in its results. There are seven tables. These tables
are set in white, with centrepieces and other decorations
to carry out the color scheme. Have first table near the
door, and others arranged according to the menu, which
can be changed to suit the seasons. It is necessary to
have two sets of waiters, the first to clear away, and the
second to furnish fresh supplies. All must dress to harmonize
with the colors of their tables. Serve food in small
quantities and in small dishes. At the ringing of a bell
seven guests are seated at the first table. At the expiration
of seven minutes, the bell again rings, and those at the first
table pass to the second table, and seven other guests are
permitted to enter the room, and to be seated at the first
table. Here is where the waiters will have to hurry and
reset the tables. At the close of every seven minutes the
bell rings, signaling all to pass up one table. Seven persons
pass out every seven minutes, and forty-nine are fed
in as many minutes. A novel idea is to charge seven
cents on entering the dining-room, seven cents when
through at the last table, and seven cents as they pass
out the door, making twenty-one cents for each guest.
They will not object after they are through with the menu
at the seven tables.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_56" id="Act_56"></a>FEAST OF NATIONS</h2>

<p>The following is a description of a church supper which
was recently given with great success:</p>

<p>The Japanese table was decorated with chrysanthemums.
At each place was a Japanese tray on which a Japanese
napkin was folded in a fanciful manner. Little dishes of
rice, hard-boiled eggs, cabbage chopped fine, and small
cups of tea comprised the first course. The second course
was a turkey dinner. The waiters were in Japanese costume.
The favors were small Japanese umbrellas tied
with the Japanese colors, red and white.</p>

<p>At the Chinese table the first course was rice prepared
with curry, followed by chicken pie with the usual accompaniments.
Chopsticks were in evidence, though the
guests were not compelled to use them. The waiters were
in Chinese dress. The table was adorned with curios, and
the favors were ancestral tablets in tiny boxes, tied with
yellow, the national color of China.</p>

<p>The Hindustani table was resplendent with red and yellow
tulips, the colors of India. Handsome bowls of beaten
brass loaned by a returned missionary ornamented the
table. Four young men in the costume peculiar to India
waited upon this table. The special dish was chicken with
curry, and the favors were genuine Indian bracelets.</p>

<p>Some rare old Welsh china was used on the Welsh table,
and the menu cards, written in Welsh, were in the shape
of Welsh hats. A Welsh flag was given as a souvenir to
each guest.</p>

<p>The Irish table was served by lassies gowned in green.
The menu cards were in the form of shamrocks. "Potatoes
with their jackets on" and buttermilk were the dishes
characteristic of this country. The tablecloth was of bright
green denim and the decorations were all of green leaves.</p>

<p>The table representing bonnie Scotland had menu
cards decorated with the thistle. Jam tarts were among
the delicacies.</p>

<p>The English table was decorated in the English colors,
with the English standard as a centrepiece. Roast beef,
of course, was an essential part of the dinner, supplemented
by plum pudding, caraway cakes and tea. The favors
were red and white roses.</p>

<p>White-capped waitresses served at the French table
which was bright with candelabra, asparagus ferns and
pink ribbons. The menu cards bore the fleur-de-lis.
Peas, olives and candied walnuts were distinctive dishes.
The color scheme was pink and green.</p>

<p>At the table representing Holland the girls wore Dutch
peasant costumes and served coffee and chocolate, carrots
with cream sauce, so commonly used among the Hollanders,
sausage, rye bread and pickles, cake and gingerbread
baked in fancy shapes.</p>

<p>The German table was gay with flowers. Noodle soup,
German cheese and anise cakes were added to a generous
dinner. The menu cards were in the form of corn-flowers
and were written in German text. The favors were pretzels.</p>

<p>At the Italian table macaroni and fruit were the dishes.
The favors were menu cards with the Italian flag painted
on each.</p>

<p>The Mexican table was decorated with palms, and a
dinner very similar to one a traveler would get in that
country was served. The favors were menu cards written
in Spanish, to which tiny Mexican <i>tamales</i> were attached
by red and green ribbons, the Mexican colors.</p>

<p>Dainty arbutus graced the New England table and menu
cards. The repast was a bounteous Thanksgiving dinner
such as New Englanders know how to provide. Baked
beans and brown bread were on the menu, as were also
several kinds of pie and apple-sauce.</p>

<p>The Western table was waited upon by a boy and girl
dressed as Indians with the ornaments they admire. The
table was ornamented with flowers. The dinner cards
showed paintings of Indian heads and the favors were little
paper canoes. The cakes, fruit, etc., were served in
Indian baskets.</p>

<p>The Southern table had a menu different from all the
others. Among the good things were a whole roast pig,
corn bread, warm biscuit and sweet potatoes. There were
colored waiters in conventional white linen suits. The
favors that stood by each plate were little Dinah dolls.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_57" id="Act_57"></a>FISH MARKET</h2>

<p>A rustic bridge was built out from one side of the platform
forming a square space in one corner of the room
that was used for a fish pond. Rocks and ferns were
grouped along the edge of the platform, the floor was covered
with green carpet, and a pretty meadow scene painted
on coarse cotton was hung at the back, making a very
picturesque setting for the pond. Steps led up to the
bridge, and at the foot was a rustic lodge where, on payment
of a fee, the prospective fisher was given a pole and
a circle of cardboard, upon which was marked the number
of times he was entitled to fish. Thus equipped, he went
up on the bridge and fished in the pond. Additional fishing
tickets were sold by the bridgekeepers. Articles of all
description and varying values were fished forth from the
pond, which made it all the more exciting. Refreshments
were served in the hall and there were a candy and cake
table and two stalls where fancy articles were sold. One
of these stalls bore the sign, Fish Market. Here fish of
many brilliant colors and quaint shapes were for sale; they
were blotters, shaving cases, pincushions, sachet bags,
needle-books, housewives, pen-wipers, spool and veil cases,
emeries, court-plaster cases and kites. They were made
of inexpensive materials, but their novelty caused them to
sell rapidly. The fish market was well patronized. At
the other stall, pillows and lamp-shades were sold. Red
linen pillows shaped like Japanese fish and worked with
black attracted a great deal of attention; other pillows had
poster fish swimming across them, and still others were
adorned with borders of fishes and anglers' maxims. Fish
lamp-shades&mdash;scarlet, yellow and delicately tinted&mdash;found
a ready sale among the young people, and caused much
mirth. On the cake and candy table there were many
toothsome fishes&mdash;chocolate and clear candy fish, boxes of
candy decorated with fishing scenes in water-color and pen
and ink, sandwiches cut out with fish-shaped tin cutters,
also fish-shaped cookies and small iced cakes. The tops
of the large cakes were ornamented with fish designs done
with contrasting colors of icing.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_58" id="Act_58"></a>FLAGS OF NATIONS</h2>

<p>Secure as many cards as there are to be guests, and
paint or paste on each of them some five or six small flags
of different nations, numbering each flag. Sometimes one
can obtain small buttons with these flags on them, and
these answer quite as well. It is better to have each card
different, and to assort the flags, so that every card may
contain some not very generally known. The United
States flag might be omitted, as every one would be familiar
with that; but the flag of Liberia could be used on
several cards, as its resemblance to our flag would be apt
to deceive many. Plates showing the various national
flags in colors may be found in the front of almost any unabridged
dictionary.</p>

<p>Hand a card and a pencil to each guest. The pencil
may be made quite attractive by covering it with a strip of
crepe paper in some bright color. This can be easily accomplished
by cutting the paper into lengths a little longer
than the pencil, pasting one side, and rolling the pencil in
the paper, then tying with a bow of narrow ribbon. After
the guests are supplied with cards and pencils let each one
write opposite the flags the names of the countries whose
emblems they are. This will be found no easy matter,
unless the guest should be a sailor or a globe-trotter, and
many amusing guesses will be recorded.</p>

<p>The one who succeeds in guessing the countries correctly,
or in guessing nearest, might be rewarded with a
United States flag pin or a pretty silk flag. For making
awards the hostess should have a list of the flags that are
on each card, which should be numbered, and compare
the list with the guesses handed in by the company.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_60" id="Act_60"></a>FLOWER BAZAAR</h2>

<p>Six booths, if properly planned, will mean a small but
picturesque bazaar. Five of these booths may represent
flowers, and many of the articles sold from them may be
made at home by members of the society which the sale is
designed to aid.</p>

<p>Drape the Lily booth in white, decorate it with Easter
lilies and light it with fairy lamps with white shades.
Little novelties for Easter gifts may be sold here&mdash;the
pretty trifles which are easily made.</p>

<p>The Violet booth may be almost self-decorative if Easter
cards and dainty booklets bearing the flower are displayed.
Many choice bits of verse and short paragraphs of uplifting
thought may be found in the religious publications of to-day,
and if these are carefully mounted on white cards and
tied with violet ribbon to a bunch of the fresh flowers they
will make the most cheering of Easter messages. Provision
should be made at the booth for the cards to be autographed
with the names of the senders.</p>

<p>The Tulip booth may be the gayest of the gay, and
there the children should find Easter eggs in all colors of
the rainbow. The booth should be lighted with gay
lanterns. Those in charge should appear in Oriental costumes.</p>

<p>The choice of decorations for the Pansy booth is a wide
one. Light green would make a good background to set
off the bowls of different colored blossoms adorning the
table. At this booth flower seeds, bulbs and plants of all
kinds might be on sale. Seedlings are always ready
sellers.</p>

<p>A booth which would prove very popular with housewives
would be the one where Daffodils are in evidence,
and there the egg delicacies for Easter menus might be on
sale: stuffed eggs, pickled eggs, egg salad, custards, and
angel and sponge cakes. Over this booth place a large
yellow umbrella, fringed with daffodils. On a card fastened
to the handle have the familiar quotation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">"Daffodils,</p>
<p>That come before the swallow dares."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Butterflies fluttering over the Candy booth, as if attracted
by the sweets there, will induce others to come for
the same sweets. The butterflies may be made of crepe
paper and suspended above the booth by invisible wires;
the vibration of the air will make them appear very real.
The little maid who presides should be gowned to represent
a butterfly.</p>

<p>Care should be taken that the attendants at the different
booths are dressed in colors to harmonize with the decorative
scheme.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_62" id="Act_62"></a>FLOWER LUNCHEONS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy Luncheon.</span>&mdash;Just before luncheon the hostess
may crown each guest with a wreath, which she has
prepared by tying the blossoms on circles of fine
wire.</p>

<p>In the centre of the luncheon-table have a large bunch
of blossoms and also a few scattered carelessly over the
table. Trim the edge of the table with a chain of daisies,
looped up here and there. At each corner have a large
bow of ribbon, either white or of three colors, yellow,
green and white.</p>

<p>Serve only light refreshments. Yellow and white ices
served together would be pretty. By all means have your
cakes cooked in patty-pans. Ice the little cakes with
chocolate, and on top of each have a life-size daisy. Any
amateur can make this decoration successfully. Boil your
icing thick and squeeze it through a small funnel made of
thick writing-paper in order to make the long, narrow,
white petals of a daisy. Reserve a small portion of the
icing and tint it bright yellow for the centres. The effect
will be quite pretty.</p>

<p>After refreshments are served supply each guest with a
sheet of paper and a tiny pencil with a ribbon bow at the
end (these pencils can be purchased for a cent apiece).
Announce that the guest who draws the most natural daisy
will be awarded a prize. Distribute the blossoms for
models. Pin all of the papers upon the wall and let the
guests decide which is the most lifelike flower. Award a
pretty book to the one who succeeds best and a booklet of
pressed flowers to the second best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buttercup Luncheon.</span>&mdash;A very effective arrangement
of buttercups for a luncheon is here suggested. It must
be remembered that this flower closes at night and therefore
is not suitable for an evening decoration. In the
centre of the table arrange a circle of large rock ferns, and
in the circle thus made place an inverted round pudding-dish,
surrounding it with a large wreath of buttercups.
Place the wreath so that half of each fern leaf will project
beyond the buttercups. On the pudding-dish, the sides
of which are hidden by the wreath, place a fern-dish full
of growing ferns, and almost hidden among them a green
glass vase filled with buttercups and grasses. This same
idea may be carried out with daisies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ox-Eyed Daisies</span> may be used for a luncheon-table decoration
very effectively. In the centre of a round table,
arranged to seat eight people, place a mound of daisies and
mountain ferns and have a rope of daisies running from
each plate to the centre. The ends of the ropes may be
hidden in the mound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violet Luncheon.</span>&mdash;In the centre of a table stand a
large cut-glass bowl on a violet embroidered centrepiece.
Fill this bowl with smilax and pink carnations. In the
centre of the bowl place a tall green glass vase and make
it secure by passing four lengths of ribbon crossed over the
top of it, fastening the ends on the edge of the centrepiece
with little bows. In the green vase place eight bunches
of violets. From each bouquet run violet baby-ribbons
ending in a little bow at each place. This will make a
number of ribbons resembling a May-pole. After the
luncheon each guest may unfasten the little bow at her
place, give the ribbon a jerk, and draw a bunch of violets.
The ribbons passing over the top of the vase will hold the
vase firmly in place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apple-Blossom Luncheon.</span>&mdash;For this use blossoms
which are but half blown. Place branches of them in glass
bottles full of water and fasten with wires to the backs of
the pictures in the dining-room. The sideboard should be
covered with great branches put in tall cut-glass vases and
low silver bowls; the mantel banked, and in the corners
of the room tall Japanese jars filled with great spraying
branches. In the centre of the table may be placed a vase
filled with pure white cherry blossoms. The candlesticks
should be shaded with white and silver. Back of a screen
at each end of the room a lamp may be set to give a
brilliant light to the flowers on the wall, without the glare
of the lamp being visible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pansy Luncheon.</span>&mdash;A pretty and an original way to
decorate a table with pansies when one has quantities of
these flowers is to place in the centre of the table upon a
glass salver an old-fashioned glass fruit-bowl on a pedestal.
Fill the fruit-bowl and salver with white cornmeal which
has been well soaked in cold water, and in this insert the
pansy stems. They should be placed as thickly as possible.
Around the outer edge of the salver have a border
of maidenhair fern. An oblong glass dish arranged in a
similar manner may be placed at each end of the table.
If desired little dishes arranged in the same way may also
be used.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rainy-Day Luncheon.</span>"&mdash;This is certainly an original
idea. Place an old umbrella frame vertically in a fernery and
twist smilax around the frame and down each spoke. At
the base of the fernery make a bed of violets as large
around in circumference as the umbrella. At the luncheon
hour hide a small lump of ice in the smilax at the end of
each spoke, allowing it to melt and drip on the violets.
This makes a pretty decoration for a luncheon, particularly
if wild violets can be procured.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_63" id="Act_63"></a>FLOWER PARTY</h2>

<p>When the guests have assembled, each one is given a
tiny flower-pot. These are easily made out of red paper&mdash;a
long strip and a round, with the aid of the mucilage pot.
In these tiny pots the following list of flowers to be guessed
is tucked away:</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Make These Hidden Flowers Sprout</span></p>
<ol>
<li>An amiable man. (Sweet William)</li>

<li>The pulse of the business world. (Stocks)</li>

<li>A title for the sun. (Morning-glory)</li>

<li>A bird and a riding accessory. (Larkspur)</li>

<li>A pillar of a building and a syllable that rhymes
with dine. (Columbine)</li>

<li>A flower between mountains. (Lily of the valley)</li>

<li>A farewell sentiment. (Forget-me-not)</li>

<li>A dude and an animal. (Dandelion)</li>

<li>A part of the day. (Four-o'clock)</li>

<li>The result of Cupid's arrows. (Bleeding heart)</li>

<li>The place for a kiss. (Tulips)</li>

<li>A yellow stick. (Goldenrod)</li>

<li>A product of the dairy and a drinking utensil.
(Buttercup)</li>

<li>One of the Four Hundred. (Aster)</li>

<li>What Cinderella should have advertised for.
(Lady's slipper)</li>

<li>A wild animal and a bit of outdoor wearing apparel.
(Foxglove)</li>
</ol>

<p>The list of answers is of course kept in hand by the
hostess. When the first part of the game has been played
and the answers verified, a continuation of the fun is a
contest of all as to who can write the best verse containing
in any way whatever all the above flowers. Judges must
be appointed, and, of course, prizes awarded for the verse
contest as well as for the guessing game. This last contest
may be omitted, if wished, but it adds fun and calls
forth much ingenuity and cleverness. The prizes might
be little potted plants, so many of which grace the florists'
windows at this time of year; these for the women, and
scarf-pins in the shape of flowers for the men.</p>

<p>To select partners for refreshments, give to each lady a
flower of a different variety; if it is impossible to secure a
sufficient quantity of natural blossoms, paper ones will do
quite as well, and these may be made at home. To the
gentlemen hand cards bearing quotations referring to some
flower, but inserting a blank where the name occurs.
Each gentleman may claim his partner when he finds the
flower that fits his verse.</p>

<p>The following are a few suggestive quotations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"A (violet) by a mossy stone</p>
<p class="i1">Half hidden from the eye."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"As the (sunflower) turns on her god when he sets</p>
<p class="i1">The same look which she turn'd when he rose."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Gather ye (rosebuds) while ye may,</p>
<p class="i1">Old Time is still a-flying."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And there is (pansies); that's for thoughts."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Pale fear oppress'd the drooping maid&mdash;</p>
<p>And on her cheek the (rose) began to fade."</p>
</div></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"And the blue (gentian-flower), that, in the breeze,</p>
<p>Nods lonely, of her beauteous race the last."</p>
</div></div>

<p>For the supper have a salad served in little paper boxes
decorated with strips of pink tissue paper cut either in narrow
slashes like the chrysanthemum petals, or in broader
ones to represent the rose. Ices can be obtained in many
flower forms, and if to these be added real stems and
leaves, the service will be as dainty and attractive as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_65" id="Act_65"></a>FOURTH OF JULY MUSEUM</h2>

<p>The invitations, gay with the national colors, stated that
Miss Blank, in order to encourage patriotism in her native
town, had made a museum collection of curios connected
with noted Americans, and bade a choice selection of her
fellow-townsmen to meet and view the rare objects.</p>

<p>The booklets passed around among the guests upon
their arrival were attractive enough, a tiny flag being
painted in one corner of the cover, which also contained
the legend:</p>

<p class="center">The Fourth of July Museum<br />
    At Miss Blank's<br />
    July the Fourth<br />
Nineteen hundred and blank.</p>

<p>A red, white and blue ribbon held the booklet together,
and at the end of this was a small white pencil.</p>

<p>We found it best to pair off the players, for two heads
are so much better than one, and it is a great satisfaction
to give help to one's neighbor without fear and without reproach.
Each of the booklets contained a date or an
event in United States history, and the man who drew the
booklet containing "1492" became the partner of the
girl who held "Discovery of America."</p>

<p>The museum specimens were arranged on tables or
mounted on cards, and each one was numbered conspicuously.
The following list of twenty-two names was used.
It can be lengthened, or the celebrities may be otherwise
represented, according to the resources of the hostess.
Magazine pictures of the articles may be substituted for the
real thing, to simplify preparations. Here is the list, which
may be greatly extended:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Paul Revere&mdash;a toy horse with rider, labeled "The
Horse Travels Best by Night."</li>

<li>Abraham Lincoln&mdash;two small darkies, labeled "All
Free."</li>

<li>Washington&mdash;a bunch of cherries, labeled "Our National
Fruit."</li>

<li>Carrie Nation&mdash;a toy hatchet, labeled "You Think You
Know. Guess Again."</li>

<li>General Grant&mdash;a chocolate cigar.</li>

<li>Theodore Roosevelt&mdash;a doll's Rough Rider hat.</li>

<li>Richmond Hobson&mdash;a confectioner's "kiss."</li>

<li>Barbara Frietchie&mdash;the national flag.</li>

<li>Theodore Thomas&mdash;a bar of music and a street-car <i>conductor's</i>
cap.</li>

<li>Benjamin Harrison&mdash;his grandfather's hat.</li>

<li>Mark Twain&mdash;<i>Two</i> pencil-<i>marks</i>.</li>

<li>P. T. Barnum&mdash;a hippopotamus, labeled "The Greatest
Show on Earth."</li>

<li>Harriet Beecher Stowe&mdash;"Uncle Tom's Cabin," represented
by a toy negro cabin.</li>

<li>Priscilla Alden&mdash;a picture of a Puritan at a spinning-wheel.</li>

<li>Jefferson Davis&mdash;a Confederate dollar bill.</li>

<li>William J. Bryan&mdash;a silver dollar (number <i>sixteen</i> in the
collection).</li>

<li>Miss Stone&mdash;the <i>stone</i> figure of a woman, labeled "Kidnapped,"
or a copy of Stevenson's "Kidnapped."</li>

<li>Joseph Jefferson&mdash;a little dog, labeled "My Dog Schneider."</li>

<li>Nathaniel Hawthorne&mdash;"The Scarlet Letter," represented
by a medium-size red envelope.</li>

<li>Eli Whitney&mdash;a cotton-gin, represented by a branch of
cotton, and a bottle, labeled "Pure Holland Gin."</li>

<li>Robert Fulton&mdash;a toy steamboat.</li>

<li>Benjamin Franklin&mdash;a kite and a key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The national colors may be used effectively in the decorations
of the rooms or of the table, and the prizes for
the winners may be silk flags, photographs of historic places
or other souvenirs suggestive of the day.</p>

<p>Appropriate place-cards for a Fourth of July luncheon or
dinner may be made by covering small glass bottles about
the size of a firecracker with red tissue paper, and filling
them with little candies. By cutting the corks even with
the bottles and drawing a small piece of twine through for
a fuse, a clever imitation of a cracker is made. The names
of the guests may be put vertically on the bottles.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_66" id="Act_66"></a>GAME OF NATIONS</h2>

<p>Provide each guest with a list of questions, with spaces
left for the answers. The answers consist of words ending
in "N-A-T-I-O-N." Here are the questions and the answers:</p>

<table summary="Game of Nations">

<td>1. A popular flower.</td>
<td>1. Carnation.</td>

<tr>
<td>2. Unruliness.</td>

<td>3. A gift for charitable purposes.</td>
<td>3. Donation.</td>

</table>

<p>The prizes should then be awarded. A pretty silk banner
will be acceptable to a man, while a big bunch of red
and white carnations tied with a blue ribbon, or a pound
of confectionery in a box decorated with flags and other
patriotic emblems will make a pretty gift for a lady.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_67" id="Act_67"></a>GEOGRAPHICAL GAME</h2>

<p>Seat the players in a ring. Let the first one say aloud
the name of a city, mountain, river, lake, etc., located in
any part of the world; the next player give a name beginning
with the final letter of the previously said name, and
the third supply one beginning with the final letter of the
second, and so on around the ring. Thus: America,
Athens, Santiago, Ohio. Each player is allowed thirty
seconds in which to think. If, by the end of that time, he
has failed to supply a name, he must drop out of the game.
The one who keeps up longest is the champion. Any
player, at any time, may be challenged to give the geographical
location of the place he has named. If, on demand,
he cannot do so he must pay a forfeit.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_68" id="Act_68"></a>GEORGE AND MARTHA TEA</h2>

<p>The walls should be hung with red, white and blue
bunting, relieved at regular intervals with shields and
small hatchets made of flowers in the national colors.</p>

<p>Have George and Martha receive the guests, and there
may be also a number of men and women attired in colonial
costumes to introduce strangers and see that all have a
good time.</p>

<p>Behind a bower of foliage an orchestra might play the
national airs, and as the object of the evening should be to
promote sociability, it would be well to have a number of
interesting games in which all can join.</p>

<p>One of these might be a list of the presidents in anagram
form, written on a large blackboard; the names in parentheses,
of course, are not written out, thus:</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour present to the most successful
guesser a George Washington hat of violet candy, filled
with red and white bonbons.</p>

<p>But let the main feature of the evening be a small room
fashioned into a portrait-drawing studio, the lads and lassies
in charge and everything about the room having an
old-time look.</p>

<p>Above the door have printed in the quaint spelling of
long ago that all who wish can have a silhouette picture of
themselves for only five cents, and doubtless a goodly sum
will be realized, as people are always interested, not only
in their own, but in their friends' physiognomy, and much
fun will follow in exchanging shadow pictures.</p>

<p>Have ready a quantity of large sheets of paper, black
on one side and white on the other, also white cardboard;
a sheet of paper is to be fastened to the wall, white side
out, and a lighted candle placed about three feet from the
paper. Then the one having his picture taken is seated
between the candle and wall, so that a strongly defined
profile falls upon the paper; the shadow is to be traced
with a steady hand, cut out, and then pasted on the cardboard,
with the black side of the paper out.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned candelabrum, surrounded by a wreath
of blue violets and red and white carnations, might grace
the centre of the dining-table, and at either end tall silver
candlesticks with candles burning under shades of a rosy
hue might be placed.</p>

<p>Let the bonbons be held in boxes imitating the cocked
hat of the Continental Army; have sandwiches of different
kinds and sorts, with tiny silk flags bearing the name
of the sandwich. Besides these the eatables might consist
of good old-fashioned gingerbread, crullers, doughnuts,
and coffee, followed by apples and nuts.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_70" id="Act_70"></a>GOLF LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>When our golfing enthusiast desires to entertain her golfing
friends, she cannot do better than bid them to a luncheon
set to the keynote of their favorite sport.</p>

<p>Naturally, the table decorations will be red and green&mdash;deep
red roses or scarlet geraniums laid in flat bunches
upon the "fair field" of snowy cloth and encircling the
dishes, caught together by "links" of smilax. Perhaps,
too, pale green candles, beneath ruby-hued shades, might
still further carry out the scheme of color.</p>

<p>The table may be arranged with a "putting green" in
the centre made of a square of sponge cake frosted with
pistachio. A little hole should be cut in the centre. Miniature
caddy bags made of red satin and filled with red geraniums
and ferns are pretty decorations. A little golf ball
for the "putting green" can be made by covering a preserved
cherry with white icing. "Bunkers" can be made
across the corners of the table by using fine wire netting.
At each place a small caddy bag can hold the knives, forks,
and spoons of the service, and in the bottom of the bag
can be placed a "Jackson ball"&mdash;one of those hard,
striped red and white, old-fashioned candies.</p>

<p>The bread sticks and cheese straws should be fashioned
like golfing sticks, and the ices be in the form of balls,
small and white. Lastly, with the coffee and bonbons, are
passed souvenir cards on which are daintily painted bags
of golfing implements, heads of pretty girls in outing hats,
or bits of rural landscape.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_72" id="Act_72"></a>GOOD LUCK PARTY</h2>

<p>This was given by a clever maiden to a departing girl
friend, but the idea could be utilized in various ways.</p>

<p>Each invitation took the form of a cordial note which
was written on white note-paper bordered with pen-and-ink
sketches of horseshoes, wishbones and four-leaf clovers.</p>

<p>Enclosed with each invitation was a guest card with the
name of the person receiving it written in gilt at the top.
Below this was a row of horseshoes, also done in gilt.
Each guest was requested to write on this card a toast, in
rhyme, to the departing friend, and to bring it to the party
on the appointed evening.</p>

<p>The decorations of the rooms upon the evening of the
party were appropriate to the occasion. Horseshoes gilded
or covered with tin-foil hung over the folding doors and
window-curtains, and depended from the chandeliers,
which were draped with festoons of ribbon ornamented
with wishbones and horseshoes of all sizes cut from gilt
paper.</p>

<p>A large screen standing in front of the dining-room doors
was decorated with artificial clover blossoms. In the dining-room
similar decorations prevailed. In the centre of
the dining-table, upon a centrepiece embroidered with the
emblems of good luck, stood a candelabra bearing green
and white candles. Encircling the centrepiece was a large
horseshoe of cardboard covered with green paper. Outside
the horseshoe outlining it were small glasses resting on
green paper clover leaves.</p>

<p>At each corner of the table was placed a plate of
delicious sugar cookies baked in the shape of four-leaf
clovers; each one was topped with a gilded wish-bone.</p>

<p>The chairs were arranged around the room in the form
of a horseshoe.</p>

<p>The main feature of the evening was the hunt for four-leaf
clovers. These leaves, which were cut out of green
glac paper, had been hidden by the hostess in every nook
and corner of the down-stairs rooms, and much amusement
was afforded the young people as they eagerly sought
them. At the conclusion of a given time the signal to
stop hunting was given and each guest counted the leaves
he or she had found. The one having the greatest number
was presented with a dainty stick-pin in the shape of a four-leaf
clover.</p>

<p>The refreshments consisted only of ginger ale and
cookies, and as her guests partook of them the hostess read
aloud the toasts which had been handed to her. She
presented them at the conclusion of the evening to the
guest of honor.</p>

<p>Each guest was next asked to tell "the biggest piece of
good luck which ever came to you." The numerous
recitals given created no end of fun.</p>

<p>When the party broke up and the good-nights were said
each guest carried away as a souvenir of the occasion a
bright new penny for a "luck piece."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_73" id="Act_73"></a>GYPSY FORTUNE-TELLING</h2>

<p>Added to the charm and mystery of having one's
fortune told is the great pleasure which may be derived
from having it told by a gypsy, even though she may be
an amateur.</p>

<p>An hour of amusement may be passed very delightfully
in this way, provided the hostess can make the necessary
arrangements with some quick-witted, bright young girl,
who will be willing to take the part of the gypsy. Several
days before the evening's entertainment the hostess should
give her friend a list of the expected guests, with a few
notes concerning their traits of character, environment,
etc., and these suggestions, in addition to the knowledge
of the persons which she possesses, and her own inventiveness,
will give her an excellent opportunity apparently to
look back in the past, and forward to the future&mdash;especially
if she happen to discover that any engaged couples are to
be present. The gypsy should arrive at the house of the
hostess a little early on the evening of the entertainment,
and be shown to an up-stairs room to don her gypsy attire.
She should then descend to the dimly-lighted parlor and
seat herself in readiness for the guests when they shall
arrive.</p>

<p>As the guests arrive and remove their wraps they should
be received and greeted in the library or reception-room,
and the hostess should then announce that a gypsy is in
the parlor. Having learned in some way that there was
to be a large party there, she has begged the privilege of
coming in to tell fortunes for the pretty ladies, so that she
might earn a few pennies. The guests repair to the dimly-lighted
parlor, where the gypsy is seated. As each guest
advances and seats himself, the gypsy takes the extended
right hand and reads the lines&mdash;improvising as she does so
in broken English.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_74" id="Act_74"></a>HALLOWE'EN BOX CAKE</h2>

<p>The newest fashion in Hallowe'en supper-table decoration
is a cake made of white pasteboard boxes, in shape
like pieces of pie, which fit together and give the appearance
of a large cake. Each one of the boxes is covered
with a white paper which resembles frosting. At the close
of the feast the pieces are distributed, each box containing
some little souvenir suitable to Hallowe'en. One box, of
course, contains a ring, another a thimble, a third a piece
of silver, a fourth a mitten, a fifth a fool's cap, and so on.
Much fun is created as the boxes are opened, and the person
who secures the ring is heartily congratulated. The
unlucky individual who gets the fool's cap must wear it
for the evening.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_75" id="Act_75"></a>HALLOWE'EN GAMES</h2>

<p>Have a card and a candle for each guest, the candles in
as many different colors as possible, and one corner of
each card turned down and tied with baby ribbon&mdash;one
color for ladies, and another for gentlemen. On the
cards have couplets written foretelling future events, such
as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Who gets the candle colored red</p>
<p>Will have long life, but never wed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>If you choose the candle green</p>
<p>You'll have the prettiest wife e'er seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>For you the kind fates have a plan</p>
<p>Whereby you sure <i>will</i> get a man.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let each guest take a card and a candle (if the base of
the candle is warmed it will stick to the card), read the
couplet aloud, then light the candle, and holding it at
arm's length blow it out. If it is blown out upon the first
trial the person will be married within a year; if upon the
second trial, within two years, etc.</p>

<p>Write rhymes of four or six lines on thin paper, and
place in chestnut shells. Tie together with ribbon, the
ladies' in one color, the gentlemen's in another. If there
are personal hits in the rhymes, tie the name of the person
for whom each one is intended on the outside of the
shell.</p>

<p>Hide a ring, a thimble and a penny in the room. To
the one who finds the ring speedy marriage is assured; the
thimble denotes a life of single blessedness; the penny
promises wealth.</p>

<p>Have one of the young ladies who knows a little
palmistry be the witch of the evening. A short, bright-hued
skirt, a gay plaid shawl crossed over her shoulders, a
scarf bound about her head, will make a very striking
costume, and, with the aid of a little paint and powder,
quite an effective disguise. If she is enough acquainted
with the guests to give some personal history she can produce
some very "telling" fortunes.</p>

<p>After the witch has exhausted her ingenuity as palmist,
let her offer to disclose the name of the future bride or
groom of each one present, by means of the fairy mirror.
The room she uses should be dimly lighted. She writes
the name on a mirror with French chalk, rubs it off lightly
with a silk handkerchief, and calls in the person for whom
the name is written.</p>

<p>Prepare a basket of rosy cheeked apples, each with the
initials of a name pricked in the skin, which names must
be used in counting the apple seeds.</p>

<p>After the supper table has been cleared of all except the
decorations and candles, have a large dish filled with
burning alcohol and salt brought in and placed in the centre.
Seated around this ghostly fire, all other lights except the
candles having been extinguished, let the guests tell
stirring stories rigmarole fashion; that is, some one starting
the story and stopping short at its most exciting point
and letting his neighbor continue it, etc., each one trying
to make it as interesting as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_76" id="Act_76"></a>HALLOWE'EN PARTY</h2>

<p>All formality must be dispensed with on Hallowe'en.
Not only will quaint customs and mystic tricks be in
order, but the decorations and refreshments, and even the
place of meeting, must be as strange and mystifying as
possible.</p>

<p>For the country or suburban home a roomy barn is
decidedly the best accommodation that can be provided.
If this is not practicable, a large attic, running the entire
length of the house, is the next choice; but if this also is
denied the ambitious hostess, let the kitchen be the place
of meeting and of mystery, with the dining-room, cleared
of its usual furniture and decorated suitably for the occasion,
reserved for the refreshments.</p>

<p>The light should be supplied only by Jack-o'-lanterns
hung here and there about the kitchen, with candles in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>The decorations need not be expensive to be charming,
no matter how large the room. Large vases of ferns and
chrysanthemums and umbrella stands of fluffy grasses will
be desirable; but if these cannot be readily obtained,
quantities of gayly tinted autumn leaves will be quite as
appropriate. Festoons of nuts, bunches of wheat or oats,
and strings of cranberries may also help to brighten the
wall decorations, and the nuts and cranberries will be useful
in many odd arrangements for ornamenting the refreshment
table.</p>

<p>Have the table long enough (even if it must be extended
with boards the whole length of the barn or attic) to accommodate
all the guests at once. Arrange huge platters
of gingerbread at each corner, with dishes of plain candies
and nuts here and there, and pyramids of fruit that will be
quickly demolished when the guests are grouped about the
table. No formal waiting will be desirable.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_77" id="Act_77"></a>HALLOWE'EN SUGGESTIONS</h2>

<p>Have mirrors everywhere: big mirrors, medium-sized
mirrors, and little, wee mirrors, all reflecting and multiplying
countless candles that burn in candlesticks of every
description (most novel are those made from long-necked
gourds and tiny squashes).</p>

<p>Across the top and down the sides of each doorway
hang festoons of yellow and white corn and turn the husks
back to show the firm, glistening kernels. Each window
can be garlanded in like manner as well as the tops of
mantels and picture frames. Clusters of red ears may depend
from the chandeliers. Here and there, in the most
unexpected corners, can be placed Jack-o'-lanterns, smiling
or gnashing their teeth, amid great shocks of corn. The
great hall and stairway can be draped with fish-nets through
the meshes of which are thrust many ears of corn. A
stately Jack must point the guests up the stairs where two
other individuals will usher them to the dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>Drape one doorway with a portire of apples&mdash;apples
strung on strings of varying lengths. As the guests pass
through, the tallest stoop for those suspended on the longest
strings and the shortest reach for those on the short
strings. Those who succeed in throwing three tiny apples
through the horseshoe, which is hung in the midst of these
apples, are assured of phenomenal luck for the ensuing
year.</p>

<p>In another doorway hang a big pear-shaped pumpkin,
on whose shining surface all the letters of the alphabet
have been burned with a hot poker. Keep this rapidly
twirling while the guests, in turn, try to stab some letter
with long meat-skewers. The letter that is hit will establish
beyond question the initial letter of one's fate.</p>

<p>Place in a tub of water red, yellow and green apples.
Provide each guest with a toy bow and arrow. The young
man or maiden who succeeds in firing an arrow into a red
apple will be assured of good health; plenty of money is
in store for those shooting arrows into yellow ones; and
good luck is in store for those hitting the green ones.</p>

<p>Blindfold each girl present and, presenting her with a
wand, lead her to a table on which have been placed flags
of the different men's colleges. The flag her wand happens
to touch will indicate the college of her future husband.</p>

<p>Browning nuts, popping corn, roasting apples, and toasting
marshmallows will add a great deal to the pleasure of
the evening.</p>

<p>The dining-table should be draped in pale green crepe
paper, the lights above being shrouded in gorgeous orange.
Pumpkins of various sizes should be scooped and scraped
to a hollow shell and, lined with waxed paper and filled
with good things to eat, should be placed in the centre of
the table. Lighted candles and quaint oriental lanterns
will add greatly to the decorations.</p>

<p>The menu should include bannocks, scones, and other
Scotch dainties. If desired, droning bagpipes might accompany
the feast.</p>

<p>After listening to ghostly tales related by white-draped
figures, the guests may receive all sorts of amusing souvenirs
from a large pumpkin placed on a table at the door.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_78" id="Act_78"></a>HANDKERCHIEF BAZAAR</h2>

<h2><a name="Act_79" id="Act_79"></a>HATCHET PARTY</h2>

<p>If the Hatchet Party is given at home appropriate invitations
can be issued in the form of a hatchet, bearing the
words in quaint letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>Ye Young Women's Christian Temperance Union extends
ye invitation to meete ye Hatchet Familie of ye anciente
tyme at ye home of Miss May Caspel, 236 Bell Avenue,
on Wednesday evening, ye 22d of Februarie of ye year of
our Lorde 1905, at eight of ye clock.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>The decorations should conform to the spirit of the
evening. A large hatchet covered with white curled tissue
paper may be hung in the hall. Plaques of little red,
white and blue hatchets may take the place of flowers, and
in the hall or reception room there should be a little table
of "Souvenirs." These should be little bronze hatchets
with the letters Y. W. C. T. U. on one side. Their
handles should be tied with narrow ribbon&mdash;red, white
and blue&mdash;and each guest should be allowed to select his
color. Thus everybody has the opportunity offered to him
of becoming a member by selecting the white ribbon, and
in this way everybody is compelled to "show his colors."</p>

<p>If simple refreshments are served, let the Japanese napkins
have a big hatchet gilded on them, and let there be
some plates of hatchet cookies, formed by the cutter that
any tinsmith will make from a pattern.</p>

<p>Have old-fashioned candy&mdash;peppermint, wintergreen,
sassafras and molasses&mdash;instead of bonbons. Play the old
games&mdash;hunt the slipper, blind man's buff, hide and seek.</p>

<p>Names for the members of the Hatchet Family who are

<li>Jinny Keturah Polk Hatchet,</li>
<li>Zacherina Taylor Hatchet,</li>
<li>Millarella Fillmore Hatchet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask the girls who impersonate these characters to come
in Martha Washington dress, a flowered chintz or silk
overdress, opening in front to show a silk or sateen skirt
of a plain color, which may be quilted if desired. The
waist is made to open over a white neckerchief and has
elbow sleeves. A little round mob cap of muslin or lace,
with a frill, a band of ribbon around it, and a coquettish
bow complete the costume.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_80" id="Act_80"></a>ICE FESTIVAL</h2>

<p>To step from midsummer into winter was a surprise,
when the admission ticket was dropped in the box at the
door on the night of the festival and its erstwhile owner
passed into the hall. Small tables stood by pine and cedar
trees that were covered with alum icicles and sifted over
with diamond dust. Here groups of friends ate their
cream and cake together, served by snow spirits in white
tarletan gowns that sparkled with diamond dust, or ice fays
whose white costumes glittered with glass beads. On the
stage, white canton flannel and diamond dust, heavy gray
wrapping paper folded into rocks, trees and a rustic bridge
made a realistic representation of a snowclad landscape.
The pleasing program consisted of dainty dances by children
dressed as snowflakes, a pretty ball game played with
snowballs, recitations and songs appropriate to the winter
season. Another novelty was a tree covered with raw
cotton snowballs, with numbers attached. These were
sold for twenty-five cents&mdash;each purchaser choosing
a number&mdash;and contained the small fancy articles usually
sold at fairs&mdash;pincushions, needle-books, cups and saucers,
etc. The windows were all screened and electric fans
hidden by evergreens kept the hall from getting overheated.
In one corner was a large pond, made of a
shallow wooden tank surrounded by more gray paper rocks
and white cotton snow, in which real cakes of ice were
floating, and from which any one was at liberty to dip as
much ice water as he cared to drink. This festival was a
great success.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_81" id="Act_81"></a>INAUGURATION DAY LUNCH</h2>

<p>The guests at this luncheon are to represent the Vice-President
and the eight members of the Cabinet, but if the
hostess wishes to entertain a larger number, she can introduce
one or two of the foreign Ambassadors. Give to each
guest, as she arrives, a card bearing the title of one of the
Cabinet, as the Secretary of State, the Attorney-General,
and, if necessary, the English Ambassador. While waiting
for luncheon, each one must guess the name of the man she
represents, in order to know her place at the table, where
only the proper names, not the titles, will be used. It will
be surprising to discover how few of the members of the
Cabinet are known by name to the majority of persons.</p>

<p>Pink carnations will be appropriate for all decorations.
Have a large bowl of these in the centre of the table, and
at each corner lay on the cloth as a doily a spread eagle
cut from gilt paper, the pattern for which can be taken
from a revenue flag or a ten dollar gold piece. Make the
distance from tip to tip of the wings about twelve inches,
and from the head to the tail seven inches. Place upon the
eagles dishes of olives, nuts, and pink candies.</p>

<p>From the chandelier to the corners of the table have
sound money festoons, which are made by cutting out of
gilt paper a number of disks the size of a twenty-five cent
piece. Paste these together in pairs, first laying between
them a long thread which connects them through the middle
and forms a chain.</p>

<p>For favors have cards of water-color paper painted
around the edges with a festoon of pink ribbon, in which,
at intervals, are knotted scrolls and documentary envelopes
upon which are printed some of the principles of the

"Reduction of war taxes," "Allegiance to the

name of the person whom each guest is to represent.</p>

<p>In the centre of the card will be the menu, which is as
follows:</p>

<table summary="Post Office Menu">

<p>A clear soup, with noodles for letters, fills the requirements
of the Post Office. The second course is creamed
sweetbreads served in small paper boxes, which stand upon
large pilot crackers, or, in army language, "hard tack."
A sheet of paper folded double, like an army tent, rests
upon the crackers, covering the box; wooden toothpicks
stuck through the sides of the tent into the paper box will
prevent the former from slipping out of place, and can
easily be removed after serving. On the outside of the
tents paint in large, clear letters U. S. A. The crackers
are to be eaten with the sweetbreads.</p>

<p>The navy is represented by having the chicken croquettes
formed in the shape of a ship, flat, and having one
end pointed, the other somewhat rounding. From a druggist
get two or three straws, such as are used for soda
water, cut them into short lengths, and just before serving,
stand two or three in each croquette to represent smokestacks.
If these straws cannot be obtained, toothpick
masts with paper sails will be quite as effective. The
croquettes should be served with green peas&mdash;small
shot&mdash;and scalloped potatoes.</p>

<p>Agricultural or vegetable salad, served in beets, makes a
most attractive looking dish. Beets of medium and uniform
size are first boiled until tender, then peeled and
placed on the ice. When cold cut off a slice at the bottom,
so they will stand firm, scoop out the insides, leaving only
thin walls. For the filling use peas and apples, celery and
beets, cut into small pieces, and mixed well with mayonnaise;
fill the beets, serving them on lettuce leaves. The
cabinet pudding is that which is to be found in any cook book,
baked in individual forms, and served with foamy sauce.</p>

<p>The ices are in the form of horseshoes for good luck,
and with them are the Philippine cakes. These are small
cakes having in the centre of each a tiny black china doll,
two of which can be purchased for a cent at any toy shop.
These are put in after the cake is baked and before icing,
leaving them just far enough out to show the arms.</p>

<p>The "coffee which makes the politician wise," may be
served at the table or after returning to the parlor.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_83" id="Act_83"></a>INDIAN DINNER PARTY</h2>

<p>Invitations may be printed or written on birch bark or
paper imitations of same, or on paper cut into the shape of
tomahawks, tepees, etc., and may be hand-painted if
desired. Decorations should be Indian blankets (as portires,
couch covers, and mantel draperies), Indian rugs,
baskets, tomahawks, bows and arrows, war clubs, chromos,
colored photographs, clay or papier-mch Indian heads,
plaques and busts, etc., any of which would make suitable
favors. A miniature wigwam made of blankets in an
out-of-the-way corner, adds effectiveness. Footman and
maids may be dressed in Indian costumes made of burlap
with bright colored trimmings and fringes; or the guests
may be invited <i>en costume</i>.</p>

<p>For table decoration a skin should be placed over table
cloth through the centre of the table and upon it an
Indian basket filled with any red or yellow common flowers,
such as marigolds or nasturtiums (red and yellow), or
better still with wild flowers, red or yellow.</p>

<p>The menu cards and name cards, of stiff ecru paper,
have Indian decorations in brilliant red, green and orange;
the candles are also striped in the same vivid colors and
the candle holders are made of corn husks. The canoe,
designed for the entree, which is the chicken, is made of
heavy brown paper.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_84" id="Act_84"></a>INDOOR LAWN PARTY</h2>

<p>Our social committee, of which I was then chairman,
wanted very much to have a lawn party; but the season
for such things was quite over, as the evenings were too
cool. However, a bright idea occurred to one of our
number, and we decided to have an indoor lawn party.</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon before it was to take place, four
of the committee took a team, went out into the woods, and
secured a lot of pine boughs, autumn leaves, etc., and Monday
evening, which was the evening before it occurred, we
increased our force of workers, and went to the vestry to
turn it, as far as possible, into an outdoor scene. We
trimmed the chandeliers, posts, and every available spot
with boughs, strung Japanese lanterns all across the room,
made a beautiful bower in one corner for the orchestra, for
which we had three pieces, a piano, a violin, and a cornet.
In the opposite corner of the room we had a canvas tent
where fortunes were told at five cents each (by palmistry)
by one of our young lady gypsies. Hammocks were
swung from the large stone posts, and a standing double
swing was placed on one side of the room, where the
younger people enjoyed themselves hugely.</p>

<p>Small tables were put into odd corners of the room,
where ice cream and cake were served by ten young ladies
in pretty summer costumes. Lemonade was served from
an old well, which was a large square box or packing case,
covered with canvas, painted to represent a stone wall. To
this we attached a well-sweep made from a branch of a
tree, tied on a large new tin pail, and served the lemonade
in small glasses at two cents a glass. During the evening
we had a male quartette gather around the well and sing
"The Old Oaken Bucket," and other selections. The
orchestra played the whole evening with very short intermissions.
On one side of the room was arranged an artistic
corner where peanuts were sold at the usual price of
five cents a bag.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_86" id="Act_86"></a>JACK-O'-LANTERN PARTY</h2>

<p>The little guests at this particular party were invited
from three o'clock until seven, and when they arrived they
found the rooms were darkened. The lamps had yellow
shades, and as such an occasion would not be complete
without pumpkin Jack-o'-lanterns, there were</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Pumpkins large and pumpkins small,</p>
<p>Pumpkins short and pumpkins tall,</p>
<p>Pumpkins yellow and pumpkins green,</p>
<p>Pumpkins dull and those with sheen."</p>
</div></div>

<p>They hung in every nook and corner. Even the jardinires
filled with flowers were made of them. Wood
was crackling and blazing in the large fireplace, as if
anxious to do its part to make every one happy, and hanging
from the chandelier was a branch of evergreen, with
nuts suspended in such a fashion that they readily fell to
the floor when given a slight shake. Before this was done,
however, each child was given a paper bag to hold the
nuts, which tumbled in all directions. Then a huge
pasteboard pumpkin covered with yellow crinkled paper
was brought in. I do not know what else it was made of;
I only know that it looked like a real pumpkin. Bright-colored
ribbons hung over the sides, and when the small
boys and girls took turns in pulling them, out came all
sorts of comical little toys and pretty knickknacks.</p>

<p>Before supper was announced the children were given
French snappers in fringed paper, in which they found
either a gay cap or apron. After putting them on they
marched around the parlors, out into the hall and into the
dining-room, while the mother of the little girl who had
planned this delightful Hallowe'en party played a marching
tune for them.</p>

<p>The greatest surprise of all awaited them in the dining-room,
for the walls were covered with large branches of
evergreens, making it seem like "real woods"; not a
chair was in the room; the little ones were invited to seat
themselves on soft cushions placed on the floor, in true
picnic style, and they had the jolliest time eating their picnic
supper from the yellowest of yellow gourds, which had
been hollowed out, lined with Japanese napkins, and filled
with just the things children like best. On top of each one
was an apple&mdash;or at least they thought it was, until taking
it in their hands, when it proved to be a bonbon box filled
with delicious nut candy. Then there were dainty sandwiches,
pop corn balls and salad in orange baskets. But
better than these were the gingerbread animals; these were
so natural looking that the little ones knew right away
which animals were represented.</p>

<p>After supper they played games until seven, when they
went home, laden with their bags of nuts and toys and souvenir
lanterns.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_87" id="Act_87"></a>JAPANESE CARD PARTY</h2>

<p>Invitations may be written as the natives write&mdash;up and
down, instead of across, on rice paper or paper napkins;
or little Japanese dolls may be sent, each clasping a note
of invitation.</p>

<p>For decorations, use Japanese draperies, cushions, bead
curtains, rugs, baskets, swords, scrolls, umbrellas, vases,
fans, lanterns, screens, bamboo tables and chairs, Japanese
fern balls, with tiny Japanese flags and fans stuck in here
and there, red, or red and white Japanese lilies, ferns combined
with red and yellow ribbons, etc.; or the walls of
the rooms may be entirely covered with branches of trees
profusely decorated with cherry blossoms made of pink
paper, representing the beautiful gardens of Tokio. Burning
Japanese incense will add to the effectiveness. The
playing cards used should be lacquered designs in red and
yellow&mdash;Starlight, Sunlight, Storm, Japanese Lady (Congress
brand), and Japanese Garden, Japanese Scenery, and
Sunset (Lenox brand). For the signals a Japanese gong
should be used in place of a bell. The favors may be
Japanese fans, toys and novelties. For keeping score,
Japanese paper fans may be had in pairs (for finding partners),
and punched with a conductor's punch for games
won. Or Japanese dolls may be used, punching their
paper kimonos. For prizes, select Japanese incense burners,
vases, cloisonn, tablewares, white metal and bronze
novelties, lacquer goods, handsome fans, or embroidered
kimonos.</p>

<p>The refreshments may be served from a buffet&mdash;the
guests seated Japanese fashion on floor cushions&mdash;and may
include rice cakes; tea punch; tea as a beverage; "Japanese"
salad, made of all kinds of vegetables, served in
inverted Japanese umbrellas; cherry sherbet; Japanese
nuts, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_88" id="Act_88"></a>JAPANESE SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>The invitations to a Japanese sociable should be written
as the natives write, up and down, instead of across, and
have a cherry blossom or a Japanese lady in water-colors
in one corner of each.</p>

<p>The guests should be informed beforehand that each one
is to tell something or read something about Japan, any
little item of interest that may have been heard or read, a
pretty poem or a little story. The hostess and whoever
assists her in receiving should wear kimonos and have tiny
fans in their hair.</p>

<p>Seats in a Japanese corner may easily be arranged of
boxes with portires thrown over them. Numerous cushions
may be piled on these improvised couches and on the
floor. A Japanese parasol may be hung in the corner,
tilting forward to form a canopy, and the walls be hung
with bead curtains. The odor from burning joss sticks
will contribute to the realness of the affair. Japanese
lanterns should hang about the room.</p>

<p>After the stories have been told tiny bits of paper and
pencils may be passed and each one present should write
down the name of the one who did best according to her
opinion. A Japanese cup and saucer are presented to the
one who receives the most votes.</p>

<p>A pretty decorative idea for a Japanese sociable is to
cover entirely the walls of the room with branches of trees,
with cherry blossoms made of pink paper&mdash;their color in
Japan&mdash;scattered profusely over them, the scene representing
the beautiful gardens of Tokio. If musicians are to
be present they may be screened by a lattice covered with
gold paper, and vines intertwined, while tiny incandescent
lights shine through. Souvenirs may be distributed from
a jinrikisha covered with the cherry blossoms.</p>

<p>The dining-room may be readily transformed into Oriental
style with very little trouble. In place of the usual tea-table
have several tabourettes, each holding a teapot, cups
and saucers, lemon and sugar wafers, and Japanese napkins.
A cushion made of matting should be placed on
the floor before each tabourette. Those who serve should
be in Japanese costume. Paper cherry blossoms, fastened
to tree branches, and lanterns would make effective decorations.</p>

<p>If it is desired to have a more elaborate menu, it may
be served on Japanese plates, and should consist of sandwiches
folded in Japanese napkins, vegetable salad, and
rice in some form. For dessert serve sherbet, calling it
"cherry blossom ice," and with it have wafers. Tea and
Japanese nuts may be served last to complete the Japanese
idea.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_89" id="Act_89"></a>LITERARY CONTEST</h2>

<p>Have small tables numbered and arranged to seat four
or six persons. Select for each table a judge, who will
distribute the cards and blanks. These judges hold the
keys to the contests, so that they may be able to mark the
players correctly.</p>

<p>Give each player a card attached to a piece of baby
ribbon that may be fastened in the buttonhole. Upon
these cards the number of points gained may be written,
punched with a ticket punch, or marked with fancy wafers
of different colors. The cards must be numbered to correspond
with the tables, and as many number one cards provided
as there are players at table number one, and so on.</p>

<p>When the players are seated at the tables which correspond
in number with the number upon their cards, let
the judges distribute blank paper and pencils, also copies
of the questions comprised in the several contests, among
the players at their respective tables.</p>

<p>A different contest must be prepared for each one of the
tables.</p>

<p>When everything is ready the hostess of the evening
should tap a bell for "silence," and announce that ten
minutes will be given for each contest; that at the first tap
of the bell all must begin to write their answers out, numbering
them according to the numbers on the questions;
at the second tap the judges are to collect the answers at
their respective tables and mark on each player's card the
number of points made. The system of marking is as follows:
Each player is given as many marks as he has answered
questions correctly, and the totals are summed up
at the end of the game.</p>

<p>During the progress of the game there must be no talking
nor any questions asked. At the third tap of the bell
the players at table number one go to table number two,
and so on, those at the last table moving up to table number
one. This progression continues until all the players
have had their opportunity to answer all the questions in
the contests. At each change blank paper is distributed,
and a bell rung as in the first instance. When the round
has been completed the points are counted and the prizes
awarded. A popular book makes an excellent first prize;
a box of candy in the shape of a book, a second; and a
"Primer," a third.</p>

<p>The following are the various contests:</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap"><b>Contest No. 1</b></span></p>

<p>Again, the hostess may prepare a certain number of
blank cards, with the heading on each one "Who and
What?" On a second lot of cards she can have pasted
the pictures of some noted writers&mdash;Thackeray, Dickens,
Scott, Dumas, Balzac, Tolstoi, Browning, George Eliot,
Carlyle, Longfellow, Cooper, Emerson, Bryant, Holmes.
The pictures of more recent writers will answer her purpose
just as well. These pictures can be obtained from
illustrated catalogues of books. Of these cards there
should be as many as there are guests if the company be
a small one, or as many cards as the hostess may desire;
a dozen is a very good number.</p>

<p>Supply each guest with one of the blank cards and a
pencil and then start into circulation the cards on which
are pasted the pictures of the authors. Let the guests pass
the cards from one to another, and write down, according
to the number on the picture-card, and opposite the corresponding
number on their own, the name of each author
and some book he has written. This will be found a more
difficult task than one imagines, and numerous guesses will
doubtless go wide of the mark. The one whose card is
filled out correctly, or the nearest to it, may be presented
with a copy of some late popular book, and a toy book
might be used as a booby prize.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_90" id="Act_90"></a>LITERARY EVENING</h2>

<p>In the note of invitation each one should be requested
to wear something suggestive of a book title.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, each guest should be furnished with a
card bearing the names of the entire company. When
one fancies he has discovered a title, he should say
nothing about it, but write the title opposite the name of
the impersonator. When as much time has been given to
this part of the program as has been thought desirable, the
hostess calls the company to order and reads aloud a
correct list of names and titles, and each corrects his card
accordingly; or, still better, let the cards be exchanged, so
that each must correct that of his neighbor, which will relieve
the victor of the necessity of announcing his own success.</p>

<p>The guests may represent their titles in as inexpensive
or as elaborate a way as they choose. She who represents
"Rose in Bloom" need only wear a full-blown rose.
"Sentimental Tommy" wears a Scotch cap bearing the
words "From Thrums" on the front, and, when talking,
finds many opportunities of informing his questioners,
"I'll find a w'y!" "The Hidden Hand" may be represented
by a gentleman who carries his hand in a sling concealed
from view. "A Penniless Girl" is easily represented
by a girl carrying an empty purse open and suspended
at her belt. "The Woman in White," "Little
Red Riding Hood," and "The Scarlet Letter" are all
easily represented. Three small white wings tied together
with a ribbon represents very well "White Wings" by
William Black.</p>

<p>It is not desirable that the costume speak too plainly of
the title selected, for the guests are expected to question
one another regarding their peculiarities, and so they must
be well informed as to the books they represent.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_92" id="Act_92"></a>MEASURING PARTY</h2>

<p>The giving of such a party is a pleasing way of raising
money for some charitable object.</p>

<p>The invitations should read somewhat like the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<i>You are cordially invited to attend a
Measuring Party to be given by the
East End Connett Y. W. C. T. U.
at the home of the President,
Mrs. Herbert B. Linscott,
Monday evening, October 29th, 1905.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Below, this verse should be printed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>A measuring party we give for you,</p>
<p>'Tis something pleasant as well as new.</p>
<p>The invitation carries a sack,</p>
<p>For use in bringing or sending back</p>
<p>Five cents for every foot you're tall,</p>
<p>Measure yourself against the wall.</p>
<p>An extra cent for each inch you'll give,</p>
<p>And thereby show how high you live.</p>
<p>Then with music and song, recitation and pleasure,</p>
<p>We will meet one and all at our party of measure.</p>
</div></div>

<p>With each invitation should be sent a tiny bag made of
a bit of silk or ribbon. On the night of the entertainment,
these bags with the money that has been placed in them
are brought by the guests and deposited in a large bowl at
the door. The party then proceeds in the usual manner.
Care should be taken to carry out the program suggested
in the last two lines of the above verse. Much amusement
may be created by having some one appointed to
take various measurements of the guests attending, such
as the length of the nose, size of the head, size of the
hand, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_93" id="Act_93"></a>MEDICAL SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Procure the small glass vials used by hom&oelig;opathic
physicians. On the outside of each one paste a narrow
slip, on which is written the name of some trouble for
which the Bible offers a remedy. On another slip write
the Bible verse which gives the cure. Roll it up, and run
a thread through it which is fastened to the cork. Here
are some suggestions: Discouragement, Ps. 42: 5; Sadness,
Ps. 16: 11; Pain, Rev. 21: 4; Doubt, Despair, Anger,
Impatience, Laziness, Unruly tongue, Loneliness, Sleeplessness,
Weakness, Pride, Bitterness, Covetousness. The
corresponding Bible references will easily be found by
using a concordance. Have one corner of the room arranged
for a drug-store. Each person will receive from
the "store" one bottle and the cork belonging to a different
bottle. He must hunt till he has discovered the
"medicine" (cork and paper) belonging to his own
bottle, and has delivered the cork he holds to the proper
bottle. Have papers read on the care of the body and the
care of the soul, and also Bible-readings on miracles of healing.
Later have some one, who has looked up the subject beforehand,
read a list of some of the most interesting Scripture
references to various parts of the body. These can readily
be hunted out with the help of a concordance. Some of
the Old Testament references will be found to be very
quaint indeed. Decorate the room with mottoes, such as:
"Is there no balm in Israel, is there no physician there?"</p>

<h2><a name="Act_94" id="Act_94"></a>MEDICAL TRUNK</h2>

<p>"In my wonderful trunk I have two very tall tropical
trees (palms); something used by an artist (palette
[palate]); weapons of war (arms); many wild animals,
and two domestic ones (hares [hairs], calves); something
worn by a king (crown); a bright garden flower (tulips
[two lips]); a musical instrument (drum); two fish and
many shell fish (soles, muscles); branches of trees (limbs);
a student (pupil); something used in ship-building (ribs);
whips without handles (lashes). a product of a spruce-tree
(gum); something used by carpenters (nails); a part of
a clock (hands); a large wooden box (chest); part of a
wagon (tongue); something grown on a cornstalk (ears);
a part of a shoe (heel); ten Spanish gentlemen (ten dons
[tendons]); part of a nail (head); weather cocks (vanes
[veins]); two kitchen utensils (pans [knee]); part of a
knife (blade [shoulder]); edge of a saw (teeth); terms
used in voting (ayes and noes [eyes and nose]); covering
of an apple (skin); a certain measure (feet); something
seen in accidents (blood); a part of a house (roof [of the
mouth]); covers to pails (lids); something used in upholstering
(tow [toe]); part of a stove-pipe (elbow); a
part of a table (legs); something served with ice cream
(lady fingers); a kind of deer (hart [heart]); part of a
river (mouth); something used by negro minstrels (bones);
best part of a goose (back); part of a ship (side); a narrow
strip of land (neck); hotel steps (inn steps [insteps])."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_95" id="Act_95"></a>MILITARY SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>This is a form of entertainment suitable for Independence
Day. "Military Checkers," played at small tables,
may furnish appropriate amusement.</p>

<p>Each table is named for some fort: "Fort Ticonderoga,"
"Fort Duquesne," etc. Though the players "progress"
from one table to another, all their honors are
counted as belonging to the fort of their first allegiance, to
which table they return each time they win.</p>

<p>The prizes may be in any form suggestive of Independence
Day. An enameled pencil in the shape of a firecracker,
or flag-shaped cuff-links, would do for the man's
prize, and a cracker-jar for the lady's prize.</p>

<p>The piazza should be strung with colored lanterns,
which can be lighted when the guests are in the dining-room
at supper. The dining-room may be simply decorated
with red roses and vines, and the dining-room
table in the same way, a big blue-and-white bowl in the
centre of the table holding the roses. These roses should
be bright red in color. Small flags serve as doilies, and
the china used should be blue-and-white. The candlesticks
upon the table hold white candles; the shades should
be red, and streamers of blue ribbons are tied about the
base of the candles, falling with graceful effect over the
brightly polished candlesticks. The bonbons are placed
upon the table in two small raffia baskets. Each bonbon
is tied about with a band of baby-ribbon.</p>

<p>When the supper is nearly over the baskets of bonbons
are passed, one to the men and the other to the ladies.
Each guest takes one candy, and it is found that no two in
one basket have the same colored ribbon. Each confection
in the men's basket, however, has a mate in the
ladies' basket, and in this way partners are found for the
old-time Virginia reel, which is danced on the piazza. As
a jolly ending to the fun the men of the party set off some
fireworks.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_96" id="Act_96"></a>MORNING GLORY FAIR</h2>

<p>At a recent church fair the flower-booth attracted special
notice. It was decorated with morning glories made of
crepe paper, in different colors. The flowers were profusely
twined among the spruce boughs that formed the
top of the booth, and were extremely effective and very
natural. The flower-girls wore large hats with morning
glory trimming, and were in light summer dresses. All
the other tables were similarly decorated, and those in
charge wore morning glories in profusion, twined in the
hair and falling in graceful festoons from skirt and bodice.
Morning glory tea was served from a small table, over
which stood a large Japanese umbrella covered with the
flowers; the cups carried out the color scheme of the
flowers. Each person purchasing a cup of tea was presented
with a flower as a souvenir of the occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_97" id="Act_97"></a>MOTHER GOOSE GAME</h2>

<p>During the evening a slip of paper is handed to each
guest with the name of one of the Mother Goose characters
upon it. The hostess retains a list of these, and calls each
in turn to repeat within the space of one minute the
familiar verse relative to this character. Failing to do this
a forfeit must be paid. The one who is most prompt in
responding correctly may receive as a prize a goose-quill
pen; and the one who fails, a copy of "Mother Goose."
Just before refreshments are served the "Goose Drill" may
be participated in to the time of a march, and the couples
proceed to the refreshment room, where they are served
with the following:</p>

<table summary="Mother Goose Game">

</table>

<p>The numbered list of refreshments should be printed
upon small cards, which may be retained as souvenirs of
the occasion. The guests order what they choose. The
key is retained by the hostess.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_98" id="Act_98"></a>MUSICAL CARD PARTY</h2>

<p>A good color scheme for this affair is brown and yellow.
Invitations may be in the form of a scroll, engraved with a
selection from some favorite opera, or may represent the
"G" clef in brown and yellow water colors. For decorations
use yellow flowers, yellow shaded lights and yellow
and brown hangings. Tally cards may be painted to represent
different musical instruments, such as violins, guitars,
mandolins, etc.; or miniature tambourines and banjos may
be used for scoring, hung by long loops of ribbon over the
shoulders, and becoming before the close of the evening
gayly decked with ribbons&mdash;yellow for the winners and
brown for the losers. Musical quotations in halves may
designate partners. For prizes, musical pictures in brown
coloring, burnt wood plaques of famous musicians, a
Flemish musical stein in brown and yellow, a brown
leather music roll tied for the occasion with yellow streamers,
musical novels, an upright piano candy box with the
key board movable to show the candy inside, etc., may be
used. Toy music boxes and grotesque musical instruments
make amusing booby prizes. A triangle, like those
for orchestral playing, may indicate progressions, instead
of a bell.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_99" id="Act_99"></a>MUSICAL EVENING</h2>

<p>The invitations should be sent in small imitation music
rolls, and headed with a line of appropriate music. As
each guest enters he receives a long, narrow strip of pasteboard,
bearing a portion of some familiar song, both words
and music. Each card bears a number, and the eight
whose cards are numbered alike are instructed to get
together and practice to sing a verse formed by the union
of their eight cards. A bell calls them to order, judges
are appointed, and each group sings its song, a pianist
accompanying them. While the judges are preparing their
verdict, a short musical program may be rendered. A
bouquet of flowers may be presented to the group whose
musical effort is considered the best. The bouquet may
consist of eight small buttonhole bouquets, one for each
member of the group. Make a list, numbering from one
to twenty, of tunes that are perfectly familiar to every one.
"Yankee Doodle," "America," "Annie Rooney," or any
of the later popular songs, are some of the airs that are
known everywhere. Number as many cards as there are
guests, with twenty numbers on consecutive lines. These,
with pencils, are distributed to the people as they arrive.
An accomplished pianist then plays snatches of each tune,
in the order that the list calls for. Just enough of the
piece is played to let the melody be indicated. Each person,
as the air is played, puts down against the number on
the card what he thinks the tune is. At the end the cards
are collected, and prizes given to the most successful.</p>

<p>To match partners, write the notes of a bar or two of
some well-known melody on the lady's card, and the balance
on the gentleman's card.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_101" id="Act_101"></a>MUSICAL ROMANCE</h2>

<p>The young hostess announced that a love story of the
Civil War would be related in musical numbers, and to
the one who should best interpret them a prize would be
awarded. All were provided with cards and pencils and
a young woman seated herself at the piano. The hostess
then asked "What was the heroine called?" Whereupon
the familiar notes of "Sweet Marie" were heard, and it
began to be understood that the names of popular airs&mdash;given
with much spirit by the pianist&mdash;would furnish the
answers to the questions propounded, to be recorded upon
the cards. The story progressed thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
What was the hero's name? "Robin Adair."</p>

<p>What was their motto? "Home, sweet home."</p>

</div>

<p>The music was a new feature, and the fact that the airs
were so well known made it the more enjoyable. The
advantage of the winner being so slight, the pleasure of
success was the more general.</p>

<p class="p2">After supper the hostess said that if they were not tired
of guessing she had another game to propose&mdash;a sort of
fortune-telling game which would give each man present
the name that his future wife should bear. It was for him
to discover it. The first name was told to make the subject
clear&mdash;which was that a chemist's wife should be
named "Ann Eliza." Then they were told to guess the
name of a civil engineer's wife (Bridget); a gambler's
(Betty); a humorist's (Sally); a clergyman's (Marie);
a shoemaker's (Peggy); a sexton's (Belle); a porter's
(Carrie); a dancing-master's (Grace); a milliner's (Hattie);
a gardener's (Flora); a judge's (Justine); a pugilist's
(Mamie); a pianist's (Octavia); a life-saver's (Caroline);
an upholsterer's (Sophy); an astronomer's (Stella); a doctor's
(Patience); a fisherman's (Netty); a gasman's (Meta);
a marksman's (Amy). Each man could judge, from his
occupation, the name of his future wife.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_105" id="Act_105"></a>MYSTICAL PARTY</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>The Y. W. C. T. U.</i></p>
<p><i>Has cordially invited you</i></p>
<p><i>To the Mystery Reception,</i></p>
<p><i>Strange and weird beyond conception.</i></p>
<p><i>At seven-thirty o'clock night fall</i></p>
<p><i>We will welcome one and all;</i></p>
<p><i>With solemn rites and grewsome sights,</i></p>
<p><i>We'll meet you all on Monday night.</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>Street and number.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>All those who take part in this should arrive early and
have everything in shape when the guests appear. First,
each one should wrap a white sheet over her and wear a
small white mask. Have all the lights turned low or have
candles, and on the gas jets or candles have red paper
shades to cast a red, gloomy light over everything. Have
each one who takes part stand like a statue, and dispose
these statues about the house in corners and in dark places.
As the guests arrive have one of the white clothed figures
meet them at the door, and without a word, motion them
to take off their wraps, and then to enter the next room.
If possible get some bones from a medical college and have
skulls and cross bones all about the room. In one dark
room should be skulls and pumpkins with faces cut in
them and candles inside. Do not have any other light in
this room. When the guests go into this room have some
small pieces of ice wrapped in muslin presented to them to
be felt of in the dark. All this time the statues should be
quiet and remain so until all the company has arrived.
Then seat all the statues at a large table with a small candle
or a dish of burning alcohol in the centre and have
each one tell a weird story. Have a witch in a dark room
with a dish of burning alcohol and have the guests, one at
a time, go in to have their fortunes told. Tricks of different
kinds can be played upon the guests.</p>

<p>The program for the mysterious company consists of a
number of contests in which eyesight gives place to the
sense of touch.</p>

<p>First of all the hostess produces a book printed in the
raised lettering for the blind and suggests that each guest
read ten lines from it. This is no easy matter. To the
contestant reading the ten lines correctly in the shortest
time a prize is awarded.</p>

<p>For the second trial of skill the guests may gather around
a circular table. Beneath the table place a covered box
or basket containing the most variously assorted small
articles that it is possible to secure upon the spur of the
moment, the more unexpected the better. No player must
see the articles placed in the basket. When all is in readiness
the objects are taken from the basket and passed
rapidly from hand to hand below the table, ending in the
hands of the hostess, and by her are placed in an empty
bag provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>Distribute pencils and ask the guests to write down as
many of the objects passed under the table as they can
remember. A prize should be provided for the person
who hands in the fullest list of the objects.</p>

<p>Next blindfold each guest in turn and place in his hands,
one at a time, various objects, the names of which are to be
guessed aloud. If curious and unfamiliar objects are
selected, this will prove very amusing.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_106" id="Act_106"></a>NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY</h2>

<p>This is a favorite occasion for a party among young
people. It should be a small party, not over twenty-four
guests, and it will be the more enjoyable if informal and
among those who are well acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>There are as varied entertainments for such parties as for
those at other seasons. A pretty idea is to confine the list
to twelve young gentlemen and twelve young ladies. The
hostess requests each couple to dress so as to represent a
particular month, which she assigns them.</p>

<p>Duck trousers, cotton neckties, and white vests are as
distinctive of summer for the young men, as shirt-waists,
duck skirts, and lawn are for young women, but it will
take some ingenuity to devise an effect that will mark a
particular month.</p>

<p>The guests should not assemble until nine o'clock.
There should be a large clock conspicuously placed in the
room, and if possible an open fireplace, with a bright fire
on the hearth.</p>

<p>The first part of the time should be taken up in guessing
the months, the company gathering before the open fire
in a circle. As fast as one month is decided upon, the
one who impersonates it rises, makes his or her bow to the
company, and recites at least four original lines pertaining
to that month. The more ridiculous or witty they are, the
better they will be appreciated.</p>

<p>After this comes the supper, which may be as elaborate
or as simple as desired, and then a promiscuous mixing
of the months will cause some merriment.</p>

<p>Just as the clock is striking twelve, there is a knock at
the door. Upon opening it, there is revealed a young man
dressed as a baby, in a long white dress tied about with a
sash on which is printed January 1, 19&mdash;. If properly
planned, the appearance of this New Year baby will cause
shouts of merriment.</p>

<p>Hand shakings and New Year's greetings follow, and
the party is over.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_107" id="Act_107"></a>NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS</h2>

<p>This game is played by providing each guest a paper
and pencil, and having ten letters of the alphabet read to
the company. These are to be copied, the guests are told
to write a New Year's resolution of ten words, each
beginning with one of the letters used, in the order in
which they are given out. These importuned resolutions,
when read, will afford much amusement.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_108" id="Act_108"></a>NEW YEAR'S SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>As the guests come in, each one is requested to sign his
name in a note-book, and to write underneath it a New
Year's resolution. An entire page should be allowed for
each one, so that no one may know what his neighbor has
written. Each guest should be given a card inscribed
with an appropriate quotation, such as "Time and tide
wait for no man." These cards are numbered.
These are passed around among the company, with the
explanation that each guest is to amuse the company for
the length of time it takes for the sand to run in a minute
glass from one end to the other (have a minute glass in
room), using for the purpose of entertainment some thought
suggested by the quotation on his card. One can recite a
poem, another tell a story, another sing a song, and so on
until every one has done his share for the amusement of
the others, following in order according to the numbers on
the cards. After each one has done his part the hostess
announces that she will now do hers and proceeds to read
each resolution that has been written in the book. The
names of the writers being given, it will cause much
merriment. Nut shells set sailing two by two in a basin of
water may be named, one for a man, the other for a girl.
If they keep together, it is an indication that the pair will
be married before the year dies, but if they separate, the
fate of the twain is sealed for one year.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_109" id="Act_109"></a>NINETEENTH CENTURY GAME</h2>

<p>In this game of guess the contestants are told that each
question can be replied to with the name of a celebrity
who has lived in, or whose life has extended into, the
nineteenth century. Each guest is given a little tablet
with his name written on every one of the pages. Two
minutes are allowed to each question. The questioner sits
with a big bowl before her, into which, when she calls
time, each player drops a slip upon which he has written
his answer. This is the list that the questioner reads,
omitting, of course, the answers:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Why did England so often lose her way in South
Africa? (Mr. Rhodes)</li>

<li>What did the Emperor of China do when the Empress
usurped the throne? (Custer)</li>

<li>What did Isaac watch while his father was forging a
chain? (Abraham Lincoln)</li>

<li>What is Li Hung Chang credited with being? (Schley)</li>

<li>The lane that has no turning is a what? (Longstreet)</li>

<li>What does a Chinese lover say when he proposes?
(Dewey)</li>

<li>What does Aguinaldo keep between himself and the
Americans? (Miles)</li>

<li>What happens when the wind blows in spiders' houses?
(Webster)</li>

<li>What did Buller unfortunately do? (Bragg)</li>

<li>What do the waves do to a vessel wrecked near shore?
(Beecher)</li>

<li>What does a ship do to a seasick man? (Rockefeller)</li>

<li>What did Uncle Sam do when he wanted to know
whether England would let him mediate? (Astor)</li>

<li>What is the chair-boy likely to do to the old lady he

<li>What does a waiter do after he has filled half of the
glasses at a table? (Fillmore)</li>

<li>In the settlement of disputes, do the European nations
quarrel? (General Lee)</li>

<li>The towns taken by the British generally lacked the
what? (Garrison)</li>

<li>What did the Jews say when the mother of Samuel
passed? (Mark Hanna)</li>

<li>In Cairo purchases are made at a what? (Booth)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Act_110" id="Act_110"></a>NOSE AND GOGGLE PARTY</h2>

<p>To fun-loving people who enjoy the grotesque, great
sport will be found in giving a Nose and Goggle Party.
Here two objects will be gained: merriment and disguise.</p>

<p>As the guests arrive, disguised as explained below, each
is given a card, perforated, with ribbon run through,
in order to wear the card around the neck, so that everybody
can see it.</p>

<p>The cards must have, on one side, a number by which
each guest is known; on the other side, a list of figures, 1,
2, 3, etc. (as many figures as there are guests), leaving
space opposite each figure for a name. In social conversation
each guest is to guess who his or her entertainer is.
With intimate friends, this may be done readily by
familiarity with the voice; but in most cases the identification
will not be easy.</p>

<p>Each guest wears a false nose and goggles. The nose
may be purchased, or made by clever fingers, of heavy
cardboard covered with chamois.</p>

<p>The noses and goggles must not be removed till after refreshments,
which may be simple or elaborate as the hostess
may wish. As you make your guess, place the name
opposite the number on your card corresponding to the
number of the person with whom you are talking; for instance,
if you think you know No. 4, turn your card and
write the name opposite No. 4, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_111" id="Act_111"></a>NOTED PEOPLE</h2>

<p>Cut out pictures of noted men and women from newspapers
and magazines, paste on white paper, and number
each one. Provide each guest with paper and pencil, having
the paper contain a list of numbers corresponding to
those on the pictures. The guests are then requested to
write opposite the correct number the name of the person
whom each picture represents. A good idea is to have
pictures pinned upon the wall, curtains, and in every convenient
place about the rooms, as the guests will then be
obliged to move about, and there will be no danger of
wallflowers. After each one has been given plenty of time
for guessing, the correct list can be read aloud by one person,
each guest passing his paper to his neighbor for correction.
A prize may be given to the one who has the
most correct answers. In connection with this, the game
of noted people can be played. Have small slips of paper
with the names of noted people written upon them, and pin
one of these on back of each guest; he is to guess whom
he represents by means of questions put to him by other
guests. This is great fun, and causes much merriment
among the young people. As soon as a player guesses
whom he represents a new slip can be put on his back. A
prize may be given the one who guesses the most names.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_112" id="Act_112"></a>NUT CONUNDRUMS</h2>

<p>Before the guests arrive hide nuts all over the rooms in
every nook and corner. At a given signal have the guests
search for them and the one finding the most can be given
a small prize.</p>

<p>Take English walnuts, split and take out the kernel;
write quotations on small slips of paper, cut in half, put
one-half paper in one nut shell, the other half in another
shell, gluing each shell together. During the evening give
one set of half quotations to the girls, the other set to the
boys and then have them hunt for their partners; when found,
each pair have refreshments together. Have the following
nut conundrums guessed, after which serve all kinds of
mixed nuts.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Conundrums</span></p>

<ol>
<li>What nut grows nearest the sea? (Beechnut)</li>

<li>What nut grows the lowest? (Groundnut)</li>

<li>What nut is the color of a pretty girl's eyes? (Hazelnut)</li>

<li>What nut is good for naughty boys? (Hickory)</li>

<li>What nut is like an oft told tale? (Chestnut)</li>

<li>What nut grows on the Amazon? (Brazil nut)</li>

<li>What nut is like a naughty boy when sister has a beau? (Pecan)</li>

<li>What nut is like a Chinaman's eyes? (Almond)</li>

<li>What is the favorite nut in Ohio? (Buckeye)</li>

<li>What nut is like a good Jersey cow? (Butternut)</li>

<li>What is the mason's favorite nut? (Walnut)</li>

<li>What nut cannot the farmer go to town without? (Wagon nut)</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Act_113" id="Act_113"></a>NUT PARTY</h2>

<p>Invitations may be slipped inside peanut or English walnut
shells, glued together, and sent in a small box. The
shops are showing big English walnuts, Parisian almonds
and Spanish peanuts, filled with confections in imitation of
the genuine nut meats, which make attractive prizes or
favors. A novelty in silver represents an English walnut
(exact size), "All in a nutshell," which contains powder,
puff, mirror, miniature scent bottle, and pincushion; a
silver peanut contains a "magic" pencil or small vinaigrette;
thimble cases, bangles, tape measures, etc., come
in nut designs; a small lace-trimmed handkerchief may be
folded and slipped inside an English walnut shell. The
diminutiveness of the prizes is emphasized if they are
wrapped in a series of boxes, each one larger than the next.
For finding partners, English walnuts painted and dressed
in crimped tissue paper to represent different nationalities
may be used, a lady and gentleman being given the same
nationality. The menu served may be made up of nuts:
chicken and nut salad, peanut sandwiches, salted nuts, nut
candies, bisque of almonds, pecan cake, walnut wafers,
coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_114" id="Act_114"></a>OBSERVATION PARTY</h2>

<p>Place these objects tastefully on the dining-room table,
each guest on entering the room being furnished with a
catalogue of the subjects, supposed to be different paintings,
made out so that blank spaces will be left to the right
for the answers. From fifteen to twenty minutes are
allowed to guess and write down the answers as fast as they
are discovered. Comparing notes is hardly fair. At the
end of the stated time the guests leave the room. Some
one then calls out the correct answers, and the persons
whose lists are the nearest correct, receive the first, second,
third, and fourth prizes, the number of prizes varying according
to the number of guests present. A booby prize
for the one who was the least successful adds to the fun.</p>

<p>Below is given the list of forty subjects, and also the
answers. From the latter you will know what objects to
collect and place upon the table. It is better not to arrange
them in exact order.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_116" id="Act_116"></a>OLD-TIME COUNTRY SCHOOL</h2>

<p class="center">(Can be used as a play.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>The Red Schoolhouse will open for the fall term on
September fifteenth. As a goodly number of pupils is desired,
all receiving this are urged to search the highways
and byways for others who may wish to attend. School
will begin promptly at eight. As there will be a recess, all
pupils should bring their dinners.</i><br />
<span class="left25">
"<i>SOLOMON WISEACRES, Pedagogue.</i>"</span></p>
</div>

<p>The coming of school-days, usually so much dreaded by
young folks, was hailed with much delight by recipients of
the above notice. On the appointed evening not only
were there present the members of the society, but each
one, heeding the injunction regarding the highways and
byways, brought with him a friend. As the teacher had
also found an extra pupil, there were just twenty-four in
the party. The boys wore knee-trousers and the girls short
skirts and pinafores, with their hair hanging down their
backs in long braids or curls. All brought with them their
dinners, packed in tin pails, in imitation of their country
cousins.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse was a large new barn, the schoolroom
being up-stairs in the hay-loft. Here were arranged two
rows of benches, one for the girls and one for the boys;
blackboards hung on the walls, and there was a plain
wooden table in front for the teacher's desk. Standing behind
this, the schoolmaster, birch rod in hand, and looking
very wise in a pair of huge spectacles, received his
pupils and registered their names in a large book before
him. Among those enrolled were Alvira Sophronia Simmons,
Malvina Jane Leggett, Serena Ann Wilkins, Patience
Charity Gray, Nathan Bartholomew Brown, Ichabod
Thompson and Abijah Larkins.</p>

<p>Each pupil before being assigned a seat was interrogated
by the teacher somewhat as follows: In what state and
country were you born? Do you know your letters?
How far can you count? Who was the first man? Who
built the ark? And so on until the teacher had acquainted
himself with the limits of his pupils' ignorance.</p>

<p>When all were seated Teacher Wiseacres announced that
school would open with singing. The pupils were thereupon
thoroughly drilled in the scales and other exercises,
the master severely reprimanding any who sang out of
tune. The lesson concluded with songs usually sung at
the club gatherings, after which a knot of blue ribbon was
given the one who had sung best, and a red bow to the
pupil considered second best.</p>

<p>During the course of this lesson, and also of those that
followed, there were frequent interruptions caused by the
refractory behavior of some of the pupils. Serena Ann
Wilkins was caught eating an apple, and was made to
stand up in front with a book on her head. Malvina Jane
Leggett had to stand in the corner facing the wall for giggling;
while, direst disgrace of all, Abijah Larkins was
obliged to sit on the girls' side for drawing a caricature of
the master on the blackboard.</p>

<p>After the singing-lesson small wooden slates (the old-fashioned
kind bound in red cloth) were passed around
and the following exercise in orthography given out: "It
is an agreeable sight to witness the unparalleled embarrassment
of a harassed peddler attempting to gauge the symmetry
of a peeled onion which a sibyl has stabbed with a
poniard." This task was accomplished with much puckering
of eyebrows, and no one, it may be said, succeeded
in writing all the words correctly.</p>

<p>The next lesson announced was reading, for which
primers were distributed. These were small books with
brown-paper covers, the lessons being tongue-twisters,
beginning with such familiar ones as "She sells sea-shells,"
"Peter Piper," etc., and ending with this one of more
recent date, taken from the <i>Youth's Companion</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">A bitter biting bittern</p>
<p class="i1">Bit a better brother-bittern;</p>
<p>And the bitten better bittern bit the bitter biter back.</p>
<p class="i1">And the bitter bittern, bitten</p>
<p class="i1">By the better bitten bittern,</p>
<p>Said, "I'm a bitter bittern-biter bit, alack!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The class stood up in front and were made to toe the
line drawn in chalk on the floor. The pupil at the head
was called upon first, and read until a mistake sent him to
the foot, when the one next to him took his place. The
master not only continually urged his pupils to greater
speed, but at the same time kept a sharp lookout, and gave
many words of warning to any whose feet were out of
order; and the frantic efforts of the pupils to obey instructions
made the lesson one of the most laughable contests
of the evening. It was continued until recess, the
hour for refreshments.</p>

<p>The dinner-pails had been given for safekeeping into the
hands of the teacher. Now, when they were returned, it
was discovered that the boys had received those belonging
to the girls and the girls those of the boys. There was a
happy correspondence in this exchange; Ichabod Thompson
receiving the pail of Patience Charity Gray and she
receiving his, and so on. The pupils thus paired off were
to share their dinners with each other. The master, who
also brought his dinner, reserved for himself the pail of
the girl pupil supposed to be his favorite.</p>

<p>There was great fun and laughter over the opening of
the pails, for the aim had been not so much to bring a
dainty luncheon as one that should be typical of the old-time
district school. The following may be taken as a
sample of the contents of one of the buckets: Bread and
butter, doughnuts, apple turnover, spice-cake, cheese and
one very large cucumber pickle. Apples were contributed
by the teacher. Dinner over, the remainder of recess was
spent in playing games. Skipping the rope was one of the
pastimes, and hop-scotch, tag, and hide-and-go-seek were
others.</p>

<p>School was resumed with a geography lesson, really a
game played as follows: The teacher requested one of
the pupils to give a geographical name, that of a country,
city, river, etc. Others were then called upon at random
to give names, each of which had to begin with the last
letter of the one preceding it. Thus, if the first name
given were Egypt, the next one must begin with the letter
T, as Texas, while the one following this would begin with
S, as St. Louis. Any one who failed to respond in the
time allowed&mdash;half a minute&mdash;was dropped out of the
class and the question passed on. The lesson was continued
until there was but one left, who received the usual
decoration.</p>

<p>The session closed with an old-fashioned spell-down, but
before the class was dismissed the wearers of the ribbons
were presented with prizes, these being small, daintily
bound books. The others, that all might have a suitable
reminder of the occasion, received book-shaped boxes of
candy. This done, the bell was rung and school was
closed.</p>

<p>This school party can be played in hall or church.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_117" id="Act_117"></a>OLD-TIME SPELLING BEE</h2>

<p>The fact that a spelling bee is to form a part of the
evening's entertainment need not be indicated upon the
invitation, it being a part of the fun to catch people unawares.</p>

<p>After the arrival of the guests the choice of a "teacher"
and two leaders is effected by ballot. The two leaders
then stand out at the end of the room opposite each other,
and each chooses alternately one of the company at a
time, to represent his side, until all have been chosen and
stand in their places in two lines.</p>

<p>The teacher, who is supplied with a book, then gives out
a word to the person at the end of the line to her right.
If the word is correctly spelled the next word is given out
to the person at the end of the opposite side at her left.
If this person fails to spell this word correctly she must
immediately leave the line, and the same word is put to
number two on the opposite side. If the word is correctly
spelled she is privileged to choose one person from the
opposite line to step over to the foot of her own line.
Another word is then given to the opposite opponent, and
so on down the lines. It often happens that two equally
proficient spellers are pitted against each other for some
time, when the contest becomes very exciting.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Limit the Time of the Best Speller</span></p>

<p>It is a good plan, lest the contest become wearisome, to
limit the time for the last participant. If at the end of six
minutes the winner has not failed on any word given, he
or she becomes director of the revels that follow, and must
be implicitly obeyed for the rest of the evening. The first
duty is to announce a "recess," and having been previously
instructed he or she leads the way to an adjoining
room, where upon a table is a pile of boxes of various
shapes and kinds, neatly tied, which are distributed among
the young women. After which it is announced that each
box contains a small school luncheon, and that a young
man accompanies each. She then proceeds to distribute
the young men as she has the boxes. Each young woman
then shares her luncheon with her partner. Should the
box contain an apple, a sandwich and a cake these must
be halved.</p>

<p>After "recess" follow games, or music, or recitations,
as the winner of the contest wills.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_118" id="Act_118"></a>ORANGE PARTY</h2>

<p>To emphasize the color scheme, the young hostess wore
a becoming empire gown of orange-colored silk, and on
her left shoulder was fastened a large rosette of orange-colored
chiffon. Each guest, upon arriving, was presented
with a similar rosette to wear as a compliment to
the occasion.</p>

<p>The dining-room was decorated with potted plants.
Although it was an afternoon party, the blinds were drawn
and the room lighted artificially. The electric lights were
muffled in orange-colored cheese cloth, and produced a
very charming effect.</p>

<p>Over the centre of the table was spread a large square
of orange satin overlaid with a Battenberg lunch cloth.
On this stood the birthday cake, which had been baked in
a fluted mold, then covered thickly with yellow icing, and
was a very clever imitation of the luscious fruit it was intended
to represent. The cake was surrounded by twelve
small brass candlesticks, in which burned orange-colored
tapers. At each end of the table was a smaller Battenberg
square over satin. On each of these, resting in a
bed of green leaves, was an orange of abnormal size,
fashioned of papier-mch, made in two sections, though
so exactly united that the orange seemed intact. In
these were the favors&mdash;small yellow bonbon boxes filled
with orange conserves and tied with baby ribbon. Small
glass dishes, standing on yellow tissue paper doilies that
were fringed on the edges, and filled with orange puffs,
orange kisses and other home-made sweets, were placed
here and there on the table, and gave it a very festive air.</p>

<p>The refreshments proper consisted of:</p>

<table summary="Orange Menu">
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Frozen Custard in Orange Cups</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Orange Jelly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whipped Cream</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Small Cakes</td>
<td class="tdc">Orange Icing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Orangeade</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The birthday cake was cut by the hostess, and each
maiden served to a slice. In the cake had been baked an
orange seed. She who was so fortunate as to find this
seed in her slice was presented with an orange spoon on
which was graven the hostess's monogram, the date and
year.</p>

<p>Before leaving the table each guest was shown a small
glass filled with orange seeds, and was allowed one guess
as to the number it contained. The lucky guesser received
a papier-mch jewel box fashioned to represent an orange.
The "booby" prize was the tiniest orange to be found in
the market.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_119" id="Act_119"></a>ORANGE SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>In planning for an Orange Sociable use plenty of orange
colored paper, and make the decorations very attractive.
Make orange colored shades for gas or lamp globes, use
orange colored paper napkins, make orange butterflies, and
let those who serve on committee wear orange paper caps
and orange colored ties. If possible use orange crepe
paper for doilies and mats. Refreshments should consist
of oranges, wafers tied with orange ribbon, and orangeade.</p>

<p>For entertainment the old nursery rhymes should be
used. Have slips of paper containing one line each of a
rhyme such as "There was an old woman who lived in a
shoe." Pass these slips to the guests and have each hunt
up the ones whose rhymes match that he holds. There will
be four for each group, and they will then proceed to draw
a picture of what their rhyme represents. A prize may be
given the group drawing the best picture, consisting of
four very small colored babies lying on a bed of cotton in
an orange shell, the orange shell cut in half and tied with
orange ribbon. As there will be four persons in the group,
one baby can be given to each of the four.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_120" id="Act_120"></a>PATRIOTIC PARTY</h2>

<p>Drape the room for the occasion with red, white and
blue bunting. Fill tall vases with red and white carnations
and deep blue larkspur.</p>

<p>Decorate the room with banners, streamers, red, white,
and blue lamp shades, large copies of the State seals, and
the like.</p>

<p>Uncle Sam and Miss Columbia should stand in the
centre of the room and receive the guests as they arrive.
Members of the social committee, representing in some
way Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Hawaii, should
act as ushers to present each newcomer to Uncle Sam and
Miss Columbia.</p>

<p>Ask each guest to come bearing upon his garments
somewhere a symbol that will hint at the name of one of
the Presidents. For instance, the picture of a canoe out
of which persons are tumbling may suggest "Tippecanoe"
Harrison; a link of sausage or of a chain, strung on a
string and hung from the neck, will hint at Lincoln.
To indicate Washington a washing-board may be borne
in front, while on the back is a piece of pasteboard
painted to resemble a weight and marked "1 Ton." A
"G. A. R." pin fastened to the picture of a meadow may
represent Garfield.</p>

<p>Give to each guest as he arrives a list of all the guests
invited, and let him bestir himself to meet everybody, so
as to ascertain if possible the various presidents represented,
whose names when discovered he writes opposite the
proper names on the list given him. These lists will be
handed to an examining board, and, later in the evening,
the one whose list is most complete and accurate will be
adorned with a laurel wreath placed upon his head by
some comic orator. This laurel wreath may be made of
green paper, if you lack the real article.</p>

<p>Questions about past ladies of the White House may
also prove interesting and enjoyable. A few such follow,
but many others may be formulated.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>What first lady of the land fled from Washington to
escape the British? (Dolly Madison)</li>

<li>What was Mrs. Lincoln's name before marriage? (Miss
Mary Todd)</li>

<li>Name three early Presidents who married widows?
(Washington, Jefferson, and Madison)</li>

<li>What early President married a New York girl?
(Monroe)</li>

<li>Whom did John Q. Adams marry? (Louisa K. Johnson,
of Maryland)</li>

<li>What President had a troubled love affair and marriage?
(Jackson)</li>

<li>What early President besides Washington married a widow
called Martha? (Jefferson)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Act_121" id="Act_121"></a>PEDDLERS' PARADE</h2>

<p>One recently given by the young people of a church to
raise funds for charity work was extremely well managed.
Invitations were issued to members of the congregation to
attend a Peddlers' Parade at eight o'clock on a certain
evening, a small sum being asked for admission. The
movable seats in the chapel were placed so that a wide
space was left between them down the centre of the hall.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock a march was played, and through the
door at the rear came a motley procession, greeted with
peals of laughter, as one after another of the figures seen
on the streets and in the market, selling their wares, was
recognized. A little boy, seven or eight years old, with a
red felt hat, a calico shirt, and gray overalls, carried under
his arm a number of newspapers; a youth, wearing on his
head a cook's white paper cap, had a tray filled with crisp
brown doughnuts; two little girls held baskets filled with
bags of candy, and a third a tray, on which lay small
bunches of flowers. A young lady dressed as a market
woman wore a calico gown and a plaid woolen shawl
pinned over her head; on her arm was a basket filled with
bunches of celery. A young man stalked up the aisle
behind her, whose costume aroused a great deal of amusement.
Huge pasteboard placards hung over his shoulders,
one in front and one behind; the former bore the inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">WILLIAM THE CORN-CURER,</p>
</div>
<p>each word occupying a line; the back:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">MY SALVE CURES CORNS.</p>
</div>

<p>His head was covered by a silk hat, the crown of which
was hidden under a piece of pasteboard like the placards.
Then came a lad drawing a cart in which was an ice cream
freezer, labeled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">HOKEY POKEY, FIVE CENTS A GLASS.</p>
</div>

<p>An Indian woman, whose wares were Indian baskets, now
appeared, and a lady selling druggists' specialties came
next. She held a tray containing brushes, combs, tooth
brushes, sponges, hand mirrors, and various toilet accessories,
and her dress was trimmed with a border of sponges.
A slender girl of seventeen years impersonated a jewelry
peddler and gold watches, chains, bracelets, rings and
jewels of all descriptions were fastened securely to her
dress and on the edge silver teaspoons were crossed as a
trimming. Much amusement was created by a necktie
vender, whose costume consisted of a black shirt, black
cutaway coat and a gorgeous tie. On a hardware merchant's
tray plebeian tin girdles shone with as undaunted
a lustre as silver, while brass, steel, copper and wire
kitchen utensils made a brave display. Then followed a
young girl wearing round her neck a broad band of ribbon,
which hung nearly to her waist, and on which, fastened so
closely that they looked like a garland, were bows for the
hair made of ribbons of various colors. A gypsy in brilliant
apparel, and a French seller of perfumes, also gayly
attired, were conspicuous in the procession, and venders
of popcorn balls and peanuts lent variety to the scene.</p>

<p>Marching through the lane left between the seats to the
other end of the long room, they grouped themselves in a
semicircle, and then one after another, stepping forward,
offered for sale the various articles, naming their prices.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_123" id="Act_123"></a>PHOTOGRAPH PARTY</h2>

<p>This is especially adapted for the opening or closing
party of the season given by a club or society. Souvenir
booklets, containing small circular snapshot photos of each
member of the club,&mdash;each one mounted in the centre of
a page&mdash;are given the club members. A title page, with
name, date and history of the club may be added, leaving
blank pages for various memoranda. The cover may be
of cardboard, paper, silk or satin, in the club colors, with
the club name in gold. The place cards may be miniature
photographs showing pretty bits of scenery, etc., or a corner
of the room in which the club meetings are usually
held. A flashlight photograph of the club may be taken,
which will make a pleasing memento of the occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_124" id="Act_124"></a>PICTORIAL GEOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>You can help make an hour at a social fly so quickly
that the most bashful person present will say it was only
ten minutes long, by the help of cards bearing small pictures
which have been cut from newspaper advertisements.
For instance, Arkansas may be formed by a capital R, a
sprinkling-can, and a saw; Iowa, a large I, and a picture
of a grocer's scales&mdash;I-weigh; Sacramento, by a sack,
"ra," a group of men, and the toe of a slipper; Belgium,
by a bell and a stick-pin (Bell-gem); and so on with a
host of such names as Ohio, Red Sea, Arizona, Orange,
Wheeling, Waterbury, Catskill, Delaware, Montana,
Potomac, Charleston, etc.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_125" id="Act_125"></a>PICTURE READING</h2>

<p>Picture reading is a novel amusement which is adapted
to a small party only.</p>

<p>Provide as many envelopes and short pencils as there
are guests. On the outside of each envelope write the
name of a guest. Place a lead-pencil and a folded sheet
of unruled paper inside of each envelope.</p>

<p>When the guests are seated, present each one with the
envelope bearing his or her name. The hostess, or some
other person appointed by her, then explains to the company
that each one is expected to draw a picture upon the
paper found within the envelope.</p>

<p>No matter how crudely executed, each person must at
least attempt to draw a picture of something, and then
replace the sheet of paper in the envelope.</p>

<p>A prophet or prophetess must be appointed, also an
assistant, care being taken, however, that the former is
pretty well acquainted with the different guests.</p>

<p>The assistant collects the envelopes, keeping the names
thereon carefully concealed from the prophet. He then
takes from an envelope the drawing and presents it to the
prophet.</p>

<p>The latter proceeds to foretell the future life of the
maker of the picture in his hand, revealing as much or as
little as he pleases of the details of the picture.</p>

<p>When he has exhausted the resources of the picture, he
returns it to the assistant, who reads aloud the name on
the envelope and restores both it and the picture to their
owner.</p>

<p>If properly carried out, this is a most entertaining form
of amusement.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_126" id="Act_126"></a>PICTURES OF PROMINENT MEN</h2>

<p>If the company be musical, the pictures of celebrated
musicians could be appropriately used, and in writing
down the names of these it could also be required of the
guests to cite some noted composition of each; or should
the company be general, the pictures of men prominent in
different professions&mdash;divines, orators, actors, statesmen&mdash;could
be utilized in almost exactly the same manner.</p>

<p>Should the entertainment be given in July or in March,
it would be quite appropriate to have on the cards pictures
of the different presidents, to be named by the guests, the
dates of their respective terms in offices to be given by
them. While almost any one could readily recognize a
picture of Washington, Lincoln or Grant, there are other
presidents whose portraits are not so familiar, and it would
take a pretty good student in United States history to correctly
recognize likenesses of them all, or even a dozen of
the less familiar pictures of the group, much less to give
the dates of their terms of office. A framed picture of one
of the greatest of the presidents might be given as first
prize to the person whose card is filled out correctly with
all the names and dates, or comes nearest to being correctly
filled.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_127" id="Act_127"></a>PIE PARTY</h2>

<p>The invitation to this party should be written on three-cornered
papers, shaped and painted to look like pieces of
pie.</p>

<p>Have each lady bring a different kind of pie, thus securing
great variety. The refreshments should consist entirely
of pies and hot coffee.</p>

<p>Have each gentleman present write a recipe for the kind
of pie eaten by him, also telling how long it takes to bake it.
A suitable prize can be given for the best recipe.</p>

<p>A large pie filled with bran may contain a favor for
each guest, any little articles that will not be injured in the
baking being suitable.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_128" id="Act_128"></a>PILGRIM LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>A Pilgrim luncheon is a most delightful affair when
properly carried out.</p>

<p>The guests should be requested to dress in quaint old
costumes suitable to the occasion. If the floors are scrubbed
and sanded in keeping with the old-time Pilgrim interiors,
so much the better.</p>

<p>Candles in old-fashioned brass sticks will furnish sufficient
light. A cheerful fire in the grate, with a kettle
hanging on a crane, will add to the festivities.</p>

<p>All the old heirlooms&mdash;spinning wheels of various sizes,
andirons, candlesticks, etc.&mdash;that can be resurrected or
borrowed, will be needed.</p>

<p>Decorations consisting of strings of dried apples and
bunches of field corn, can be used with good effect. Old
blue and white coverlids can be used as hangings or couch
covers.</p>

<p>Homespun tablecloths and old-fashioned china will be
needed in the dining-room. Only old-time dishes should
enter into the menu. Below is given one:</p>

<h2><a name="Act_129" id="Act_129"></a>PING-PONG LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>This ping-pong luncheon deserves mention for the novelty
of the idea as well as for the cleverness of the hostess in
planning her menu. The table decorations consisted of
two ping-pong nets stretched diagonally across the table.
In the centre where the nets crossed, four racquets of white
parchment with scarlet edges were placed. From these
rose a bunch of asparagus ferns, and stuck amid the ferns,
like big roses, were a dozen rosettes of taffeta ribbon of six
different shades of red and pink. The name cards were
of white cardboard cut in the shape of racquets with red
edges.</p>

<p>The menu included creamed white fish made into balls,
each laid on a miniature racquet cut from thin slices of
buttered bread; French chops trimmed into circular shape
with the bone of each twisted with white frilled paper
(forming little racquets) served with potatoes cut into little
balls; balls of cream cheese served on racquets of toasted
bread, with lettuce leaves; and vanilla ice-cream balls
served on racquets of drop cake.</p>

<p>At the close of the luncheon each girl took one of the
rosettes and found in it a tiny silver pin in the shape of a
racquet to pin upon her gown. The two who chose the
same color had to meet each other in the tournament which
occupied the rest of the afternoon.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_130" id="Act_130"></a>PING-PONG PARTY</h2>

<p>The invitations, which were written on pink paper, ran
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Ping-Pong Party!</i></p>

<p><i>Polite and pretty people pressed to pleasantly play ping-pong
for prizes: pens, pictures, purses or pencils.</i></p>

<p><i>Patent leather pumps and pinafores positively prohibited.</i></p>

<p><i>Party puts in at 8 P. M.&mdash;pulls out at pleasure.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Program</i></p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>1. Ping-pong partners.</i></li>
<li><i>2. Playing ping-pong.</i></li>
<li><i>3. Partaking of prepared provender.</i></li>
<li><i>4. Presentation of prizes.</i></li>
<li><i>R. s. v. p. pretty promptly to Miss Ethel Thompson,</i></li>
<li><span class="i10"><i>179 Chestnut Street.</i></span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The tournament began with mixed doubles. A pretty
boutonnire was given to each guest. The men selected
for their partners the girls who had flowers corresponding
to theirs. After doubles were played off the singles were
on, and the prizes were given at the supper-table. A
charming Japanese fan, labeled "Pretty present to prevent
prickly heat," was the ladies' prize; a potted plant, the
men's; while some slight consolation was given the fortunate
being who almost won by a wriggly paper snake,
bearing on its harmless fangs the legend, "The perilous
python pitilessly puts a period to pleasure."</p>

<p>A rather unusual supper of sandwiches of thin pumpernickel,
potato salad, pumpkin pie, fruit punch and popcorn
was enjoyed.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_131" id="Act_131"></a>PIN PARTY</h2>

<p>The invitations to this were written on large sheets of
paper, and the sheet was then folded up small, and pinned
with a large black pin. Each guest was requested to
bring a fancy stick-pin which he or she was willing to have
disposed of as the hostess saw fit.</p>

<p>On entering, these were given to the hostess, who thrust
each into a small card bearing the name of the person
bringing it. While her guests were removing wraps in the
guest-chamber, she put these by twos (one brought by a
girl and one by a man) into small jeweler's boxes. The
name of the girl who brought the one pin was put into the
box, but no man's name was enclosed. When the time
came for supper these boxes were passed to the gentlemen,
who each selected one. The name inside indicated which
lady he was to take out to supper. One stick-pin went to
each of the pair, and these served as souvenirs.</p>

<p>It so happened that no man had the pin that he had
brought to the entertainment, and of course no girl had
hers, for she would insist that the man take the pin she had
provided. As many of these pins were the quaintest ones
to be found by the persons bringing them, they created
not a little amusement.</p>

<p>But we are getting ahead of our story, for before supper
the time was filled in with various games.</p>

<p>The first of these was an entertainment in which all the
guests took part. A fancy tray contained as many slips
of cardboard as there were guests. This was placed on
the centre-table, and the hostess called upon one of the
men to pick up one of these slips at random, and read
what it contained. He did so and read: "The tale of a
pin." The hostess then informed him that he must tell
the story of a pin, and do it in two minutes. The surprise
was so great that he scarcely recovered enough to begin
his story before his time was up. Then he had to call on
some girl, and she must take a slip, and do whatever it
bade her, for the period of two minutes. And so on until
all had taken part. Some of the slips read thus:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Speak a piece with something in it about a pin.</li>

<li>Name twenty-five kinds of pins.</li>

<li>Tell a story about a girl and a pin.</li>

<li>Give an oration on points.</li>

<li>Give a talk on pinfeathers.</li>

<li>Improvise a poem on "The boy and the pin."</li>

<li>Point out the various pins you can see in this room.</li>

<li>Tell twenty uses for a hairpin.</li>

<li>Sew with a pin. With this was given a piece of cheese-cloth
and a pin with a long thread tied to the head.</li>

<li>Count the pins in a heap. (All sizes and kinds.)</li>

<li>Make a pin stand on its head.</li>

<li>Draw a picture of a pin. (Breastpin of huge pattern.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Play a game of "ring pins." This was a variation of
the game of quoits or ring toss. Into a foot square piece
of soft pine had been stuck twenty pins about an inch
apart. The victim was given ten small brass rings, and
made to stand two feet from the edge of the table, and see
how many rings he could make catch over a pin.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_132" id="Act_132"></a>P.O.D. DINNER PARTY</h2>

<p>On the twenty-second day of February the guests were
bidden to a P.O.D. (Post-Office Department) dinner party,
but none guessed the meaning of the mysterious letters till
they were seated at the table and found that the place-cards
were unsealed envelopes stamped and directed, each one
containing a tin label similar to the ones upon the sacks
used in the Railway Mail Service. These had been made
by a tinsmith and were only strips of tin three inches long
and an inch and a half wide. The sides had been bent
over slightly to form a slot to hold a narrow piece of cardboard,
and a blue or a pink ribbon was drawn through a
small hole punched in one end.</p>

<p>The ladies' slips bore the names of small towns near by,
while those of the gentlemen had the titles of the railroads
on which the towns were situated.</p>

<p>The table was decorated with toy trains and stagecoaches
and men on horseback, all loaded with tiny mail-sacks
filled with salted nuts, candies, and even little cakes.
The guests had great fun guiding the various conveyances
around the table and peering into the small sacks.</p>

<p>After dinner the host stood in the dining-room door and
would allow no couple to pass who were not able to show
perfectly matched slides.</p>

<p>In the parlor cards on which were written names and
addresses were passed around and two minutes allowed
to decipher and write them on tablets provided for the purpose,
and numbered from one to twenty-five. At the tap
of a bell each person passed his or her card to the one on
the right, and in this way the cards made the circuit of
the room in the given time. There were enough difficult
ones to give an idea of the troubles which beset Uncle
Sam's faithful servants when handling the mails.</p>

<p>The first prize was a silver stamp-box, and the consolation
one a small United States atlas.</p>

<p>A boy with a mail-sack distributed packages of bonbons,
the old-fashioned game of "post office" was played.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_133" id="Act_133"></a>POP-CORN PARTY</h2>

<p>I was much surprised and amused at a little corn-colored
envelope which came with my morning mail the other day.
It contained, written upon corn-colored paper, an invitation
from Mr. and Mrs. Blank to be present at "A Pop-corn
Party" on the following Thursday evening at eight o'clock.
In the lower left-hand corner was written, "To meet Mr.
C. Cobb very informally."</p>

<p>In the dressing-room each girl was presented with an addition
to her toilet in the shape of a necklace of popcorn
sewed upon satin ribbon, each necklace having a distinct
color. Upon entering the parlors we found all the men
adorned with watch-chains to correspond. We were
speedily invited into the dining-room, where a bright open
fire was burning, and were told that this time the girls
were to do "the popping." And they did, while ghost
stories were told, songs were sung and conundrums given
and guessed. As the corn was popped it was given to the
hostess, who, in a corn-colored crepon gown, presently invited
all the men to take partners. This they did by
selecting the girls whose necklaces matched their watch-chains
in color.</p>

<p>Then we sat down to a veritable feast of popcorn at a
table which had been entirely arranged in corn color, and
upon which were served salted, sugared and buttered popcorn,
popcorn balls, lemon jelly-cake, lemon sponge-cake,
lemonade, hot and cold, lemon ice cream, lemon water ice
and lemon jelly. After our delicious supper we returned
to the parlor and were handed cards with pencils attached.
Our hostess then rang a bell and called for order, and
when order reigned she requested us to write eight nouns
beginning with corn, and the name of a general beginning
in the same way. In ten minutes she rang the bell again
and collected the lists. The best one read, "Cornflower,
cornstarch, cornice, cornet, cornea, corner, corncake,
cornucopia, General Cornwallis."</p>

<p>The maker of this list received a pretty corn-colored
paper lamp shade as a prize, and the girl who only had two
words on her list received the booby prize&mdash;a corn-colored
paper dunce cap, which she was compelled to wear the rest
of the evening.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_134" id="Act_134"></a>PORTRAIT GAME</h2>

<p>In this new and clever game a name card, with the
numbers from one to six written upon it, a small pad of
paper, and a pencil, are handed to each guest. The gentlemen
are then asked to select partners for each number
upon their cards, and when this is done the hostess may
give the signal for the game to begin, and announce that
"partners" may proceed to draw each other's faces upon
the pads of paper, each gentleman depicting the charms
of his <i>vis--vis</i>, and each lady doing likewise.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes a bell gives the signal for the
gentlemen to seek their next partners, and again the portraiture
goes on. When all the partners have been taken
and all the portraits drawn, each portrait being marked
with the artist's initials and a number corresponding to the
number the model occupies on each card, the collection is
pinned to a sheet or portire, and the guests are invited to
guess whose likeness each drawing is meant to represent.</p>

<p>The one guessing the largest number of portraits correctly
is given a prize of a photograph, and the one who
has made the best portrait also receives one.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_135" id="Act_135"></a>POVERTY PARTY</h2>

<p>The committee should take especial pains to have every
one enter into this party to make it a success. When it
was held at the home of the writer, the house was all torn
up ready to move out the next day, so the floors were
bare, the curtains were all down and everything looked
very much poverty stricken. All the good furniture was
moved out of the rooms, and store boxes with long boards
across made the seats. Mush and milk was served in tin
cups with tin spoons (borrowed for the party). A flashlight
photograph was taken and every one had a thoroughly
good time.</p>

allowed in which to guess and write down the name of
the Executive to whom the title was applied. The list of
nicknames is as follows:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Rail-splitter of the West? (Lincoln)</li>
<li>Hero of New Orleans? (Jackson)</li>

<li>Rough and Ready? (Taylor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let the best list of answers be awarded a prize.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_140" id="Act_140"></a>PUSSY WILLOW PARTY</h2>

<p>Especially appropriate ideas for an evening's entertainment
to be given the last of March or the first of April
are suggested by the pussy willow. The invitations sent
out to the invited friends can be written on cards brown-tinted
like the bark of the trees, and can be very artistically
decorated with the furry blooms, or with paintings
of them. Trim the parlor with pussy willows by filling
vases, pitchers, and bowls. Place the catkins about the
room and suspend branches of them from gas jets and
about the windows. The hostess can adorn herself very
prettily with these blooms by making wreaths for the neck
and hair, and by pinning branches of them on the skirt in
some design.</p>

<p>For entertainment, pin against the wall at one end of the
room a sheet upon which is sketched a large pussy willow
stalk. Distribute paper catkins among the guests, who,
blindfolded, try in turn, to pin them on the stalk. This
affords a great deal of amusement. Those who succeed in
pinning their catkins upon the stalk receive prizes, given
according to the success of the contestants. These prizes
are in the shape of favors appropriately fashioned from the
fluffy little pussies. For further amusement, have cards
distributed on which each person is asked to write favorite
quotations or original rhymes beginning with each letter
contained in the compound word "pussy-willow." These
are read in turn, and many gems are brought fresh to each
one's mind. One could also introduce a pussy willow
hunt, as another pastime. For the dining-room decoration
use more pussy willows. A pussy willow centrepiece
would carry out the idea nicely, and add to the attractiveness
of the table. Brown and silvery green are suggestive
colors for further decorations, and may be used on the
menu cards, making them simple but appropriate souvenirs.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_141" id="Act_141"></a>RED, WHITE AND BLUE LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>The entire color scheme of this Fourth of July luncheon
must be worked out in the national colors; as far as possible
the doilies used should be designed in star-shaped
patterns, with a border in wash silks of interwoven red
carnations and blue corn-flowers. Suspended directly
over the centre of the table, a huge liberty bell should be
hung, composed of red and white carnations and blue
corn-flowers. Depending therefrom should be ropes of
red, white and blue ribbon, terminating at the four corners
of the table. The luncheon to be served should be as far
as possible in the prevailing colors, the ices might be in
firecracker form, and the starry banner should appear
wherever it can be introduced. Draperies and pictures
indicative of the occasion should be placed in conspicuous
places, and do not forget a goodly supply of pyrotechnics
to conclude the day. Such a luncheon will certainly commend
itself to all, and most particularly to the younger
element.</p>

<p>Write the following verses on cards and pass around
among the guests after they have left the table. Have
each verse read aloud previous to the performance:</p>

<h2><a name="Act_142" id="Act_142"></a>"RILEY" ENTERTAINMENT</h2>

<p>A "Riley" party was recently held by one of our
church charity organizations. It proved a decidedly
unique affair and quite a profitable one also. The decorations
of the church parlors consisted mainly of paper,
which was most artistically entwined about pillar, post and
picture. A large picture of James Whitcomb Riley was
placed upon the wall facing the entrance, and over it in
pasteboard letters,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When the frost is on the pumpkin,</p>
<p>And the fodder's in the shock."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Almost all the young people who had gotten up the
entertainment were dressed to represent Riley's characters,
and several of the most important presided over the
booths. At one, which was literally covered with paper
flowers, "'Lizabeth Ann, she can cook best things to eat,"
sold cakes and pies. At another Riley's poems and
photographs were sold, and at still another "The raggedy
man! He works for pa," knocked down apples from an
improvised apple-tree as fast as he could sell them. And
among the purchasers were "Little Orphant Annie,"
"Max and Jim," "Pa and ma and me, all three," and
many others.</p>

<p>While all were busy buying and tasting the good things,
"the old band" marched in.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Somehow&mdash;anyway</p>
<p>I want to hear the old band play</p>
<p>Sich tunes as 'John Brown's body,' and</p>
<p>'Sweet Alice,' don't you know?</p>
<p>And 'The camels is a-comin'' and</p>
<p>'John Anderson, my Jo.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>And the impromptu band played them. Later in the
evening some of the Riley poems were recited.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_144" id="Act_144"></a>SEVEN DAYS IN ONE</h2>

<p>This fair can be planned by any society that wishes to
raise money and is willing to work to earn it.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Monday</span></p>

<p>Have a booth with everything pertaining to wash-day&mdash;wash
aprons, clothes-pin aprons, clothes-pin bags, wash-tubs,
boilers, wash-boards, clothes-lines, clothes-pins, soaps,
washing-powder, bluing, clothes-baskets, etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tuesday</span></p>

<p>Have everything a housewife wants for ironing day&mdash;ironing-boards,
irons, stands, holders, home-made holders,
fine starch, bees' wax, ironing-board slips, polishing irons,
etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Wednesday</span></p>

<p>Wednesday's booth should have everything for mending
day, such as needle-books, stocking-bags, buttons, button-bags,
pincushions, papers of pins, needles, thread, darning
needles, darning-cotton, darning-balls, etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Thursday</span></p>

<p>Make Thursday the reception day, arranging this booth
as a reception hall, with a good, live committee in attendance.
Have a book for the guests to register their names
and addresses (for future use). Serve ice cream, cake,
lemonade and candy. Introduce strangers and appoint a
special committee to look after the backward ones.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Friday</span></p>

<p>Let this booth be suggestive of sweeping day. Have
plenty of dust caps, dust bags, dusting cloths, brushes,
brooms, dust-pans, dusters, large colored aprons (which
sell readily), etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span></p>

<p>Let this booth be a regular bakery. Have your friends
bake various things for you to sell, and have on sale all
such articles as will sell readily, such as pies, cakes,
cookies, doughnuts, bread, baked beans, etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span></p>

<p>Have Sunday the crowning day of all. Arrange to
have a piano or organ at this booth, and secure a full choir
or quartet to sing the sacred songs; have solos, duets, instrumental
music and an orchestra if possible. Have
sacred readings and make the time spent here an hour of
sacred enjoyment.</p>

<p>If something extra is wanted let the singers dress in old
time costumes and sing the old sacred songs with an organ
accompaniment.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_145" id="Act_145"></a>SHAMROCK LUNCHEON</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Idea for St. Patrick's Day</span></p>

<p>The invitations were written upon pale green note-paper,
with a shamrock leaf painted in water-color in one corner.
The exquisitely blended shades of this leaf make it an
easy and effective decoration. In truth, we encountered
some difficulty in finding a leaf to copy; but a volume of
Moore's poems, incased by a considerate binder in a shamrock-sprinkled
cover, solved the problem!</p>

<p>The event was called a "Shamrock Luncheon," the
hours were from two until six, and the word "whist" explained
our intentions.</p>

<p>The score-cards were cut from green cardboard, in the
shape of a large shamrock; and across the back of each
was written a line of a humorous St. Patrick's Day poem,
which we had discovered in a newspaper. The verses will
be found complete at the end of this article. It is adapted
to twenty-four guests, but it is easy to insert more lines if
more guests are invited.</p>

<p>Each lady selected her partner for the game by finding
the holder of the line which rhymed with her own. The
score-cards were tied with streamers of narrow white or
green ribbon, which served both to attach the cards to the
gown and to indicate partners in "changing tables"&mdash;the
green always playing with a white ribbon. (Care must be
taken to tie rhyming cards, one with green and one with white.)</p>

<p>When partners had been found, the entire poem, sufficiently
humorous to break up all formality, was read. As
each line was read, the owner of the card bearing that line
took her seat as indicated, until all the guests were easily
and laughingly seated.</p>

<p>The six small luncheon tables were set with green and
white china, and had for centrepieces pots of blossoming
shamrock. Any florist will sell or rent these.</p>

<p>The menu was as follows:</p>

<table summary="St. Patricks Day Menu">
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Fruit Salad</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Boiled Salmon</td>
<td>Caper Sauce</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Potato au Gratin</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Chicken Salad in Lettuce Nests</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Olives</td>
<td class="tdc">Wafers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Pistachio Cream</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">Fancy Cakes Iced in Pale Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdc">Coffee</td>
<td class="tdc">Bonbons</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>This repast, served by three pretty waitresses in white
gowns and green ribbons, was eminently satisfactory.
Green and white bonbons are easy to obtain. Care must
be taken, however, not to carry the color scheme too far
into the menu, as green is not an appetizing color in all
kinds of food.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">St. Patrick's Birthday</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<h2><a name="Act_146" id="Act_146"></a>SNOWDRIFT PARTY</h2>

<p>An ingenious hostess provided no little amusement for
her guests by what she called her "snowdrift party."
This is how it is arranged:</p>

<p>First of all select from a good book of quotations or
proverbs twenty sentences applicable to snow. Write these
twenty verses on twenty cards, one verse to each card, and
number them with the numbers from one to twenty. Now
get together a half dozen pasteboard or wooden boxes, and
fill these with flakes of cotton, wool or white paper torn
into small pieces. Hide the quotation cards away in the
snow thus formed. Each guest receives a wooden teaspoon,
tied with ribbon, a note-book and pencil. The
boxes are distinguished by letters or numbers painted upon
them, and lots are drawn to determine in which "snowdrift"
each guest shall dig. The digging is, of course,
done with the spoons. Each player digs in the snow, turning
it up spoonful by spoonful, until he discovers a card.
When a card is found the quotation upon it must be read
and the name of the author, if recognized, written down.
Each author's name should be placed in the note-book opposite
the proper number of the card, in order to facilitate
the work of the person who reads the lists to decide the
prize. The cards, whether the author is known or not, are
always returned to the box and hidden away in the snow.
At the end of fifteen minutes, work ceases and the diggers
begin on new drifts. This changing is done every fifteen
minutes, a player digging always in a new snow bank until
the number of boxes is exhausted. When the game
reaches this stage all note-books or tablets are collected by
the mistress of the ceremonies. She compares the answers
in the note-books with her own list, previously prepared.
Incorrect guesses are pruned away with a blue pencil and
the correct ones counted. It is, of course, the player who
has most of these last who carries off the trophy. The
prize should be in some way suggestive of the occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_147" id="Act_147"></a>SOCK SOCIABLE</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>This little sock we give to you</p>
<p class="i1">Is not for you to wear;</p>
<p>Please multiply your size by two</p>
<p class="i1">And place therein with care,</p>
<p>In pennies or in cents,</p>
<p class="i1">Just twice the number that you wear,</p>
<p>(We hope it is immense).</p>
<p class="i1">So if you wear a number 10</p>
<p>You owe us 20, see?</p>
<p class="i1">Which, dropped into our little sock,</p>
<p>Will fill our hearts with glee.</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis all we ask; it isn't much,</p>
<p>And hardly any trouble,</p>
<p class="i1">But if you only have one foot,</p>
<p>We'll surely charge you double.</p>
<p class="i1">Now, if you have a friend quite dear,</p>
<p>You'd like to bring with you,</p>
<p class="i1">Or if you know some one who'd come,</p>
<p>We'll gladly give you two.</p>
<p class="i1">So don't forget the place and date&mdash;</p>
<p>We'll answer when you knock,</p>
<p class="i1">And welcome you with open arms,</p>
<p>But DON'T FORGET YOUR SOCK.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This little verse should be sent with every invitation to
the sociable, accompanied by a tiny sock made of silk or
lawn. On the night of the entertainment, these socks
with the money that has been placed in them are brought
by the guests and deposited in a large bowl at the door.
The sociable then proceeds in the usual manner. This is
an excellent way of raising money for some charitable
object.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_148" id="Act_148"></a>SPINNING PARTY</h2>

<p class="center">"Will you walk into my parlor?"</p>

<p>On the upper left-hand corner there was a picture of a
spider spinning his web, and a fly struggling to escape
from its meshes.</p>

<p>When the guests arrived they saw an old-fashioned spinning
wheel in the centre of the room, with flax near by,
all ready for spinning. They were told that all must try
for the prizes that were to be awarded to the lady and
gentleman who spun the best thread, after five minutes'
trial. The mother of the hostess, who had done such
work when a girl, stood near to give instruction, and to
time the contestants. Those who have no knowledge of
spinning can have no idea how much fun there is in trying
to make an even thread, more especially when surrounded
by interested young people of no greater experience. As
the different threads were finished they were fastened to a
tag bearing the name of the worker and then pinned to
a square of black cloth that had been pinned to the wall
for that purpose. When all had tried, a committee was
appointed to help the hostess decide to whom prizes should
be awarded.</p>

<p>While the spinning was going on the guests whose turn
at the wheel had not arrived and those who had already
tried were set to following the threads of what looked like
an immense spider web wound around the rooms. It was
composed of black and white threads, the black threads
being intended for gentlemen and the white ones for ladies.
They were instructed that when they found an end of one
of these threads they were to begin winding it into a ball;
but that they must do so very gently, or the whole web
would be knotted so badly that it could not be undone.
When they came to a knot it must be untied. These
threads were so ingeniously twisted together and wound
around pictures, bric- brac, table legs, etc., that it took
some time to reach the farther end, and every one had
plenty of opportunity to talk with every one else. A card
was fastened to the farther end of each thread, and all the
cards had been so well concealed from view that some
time elapsed before the guests knew what they were to find.</p>

<p>On each card were written the words, "You will take
supper with the one who holds the mate to your card."
Then the cards must be compared. Each contained a
spider web, some with four circles, some with more; some
with eight divisions, others with more or less; but there
were always two of each kind, and through the peculiarities
of these webs the partners discovered each other. The
difference in webs was sometimes so slight as not to be
detected without close observation; but it was always
plain after having once been pointed out. It is surprising
how many different designs can be worked out in these
webs. The work is really quite fascinating when once
begun, so the thought of it must not frighten any one from
giving a spinning party.</p>

<p>When the prizes had been awarded to the best spinners,
several tables were brought in and set about the room.</p>

<p>On the top of each there was fastened a heavy sheet of
drawing paper, upon which five circles had been drawn.
The outside circle was as large as the table would allow.
The inner one was only two inches in diameter. The
other three circles were drawn at equal distances between
these two. In the inner space on one table were the
figures 25; the next 20; then came 15, 10 and 5. On
the next table the inner space was marked 30, and each of
the other spaces 5 less. On the third and last table the
inner circle was marked 50, and each of the others 5 less.</p>

<p>Each player was given a top, made from a spool, and all
the guests took turns spinning the tops on the table having
the lowest figures. When the top ceased spinning the
player was credited with the number on which the point
of the top rested. As soon as a player had twenty-five to
his credit he advanced to the next higher table. There
he must win fifty points before he could pass on to the
highest table. When he had won a hundred points at the
third table he was obliged to begin again at the foot table.
The top must not be touched while spinning. Should it
drop to the floor the player must make ten before he could
begin to count again. Should he make 25 at the next
trial he only counted 15; but he had a second trial when
his top had dropped to the floor, before the next player
spun his top.</p>

<p>Each player had a credit card tied in his buttonhole
upon which numbers something like the meal tickets issued
at restaurants were closely written. When added these
numbers should make 500. The hostess had a punch
with which she cut out the numbers to correspond with
those won by the player. When any player had no more
numbers on his card he was declared winner and the game
was ended.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_149" id="Act_149"></a>SPINSTER TEA</h2>

<p>Where a party of girls wish to have an evening all to
themselves the "Spinster Tea" will furnish them with
much merriment.</p>

<p>As this sort of tea should be quite informal the invitations
may be written on plain white note-paper, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>Being a spinster in good standing in this community
you are cordially invited to a 'Spinster Tea' on Tuesday
evening, November twentieth, at seven o'clock, at 415 Madison
Street. You are requested to dress in character, and
to bring with you an old-fashioned picture of a man supposed
to have been refused by you. Be prepared to tell
the story of his wooing and to state what he lacked to make
him pleasing to you. The narrator of the most improbable
story will be given a heart.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>When the evening of the tea comes, and the guests have
all been introduced one to another, they may be ushered
into the dining-room and the supper be served. The
dining-table should be arranged in as old-fashioned a style
as possible. At the four corners place candlesticks with
wax candles, and for a centrepiece have a large bouquet
of artificial bachelors' buttons. Use old-fashioned china
and silver if you happen to have any. At each place put
a few bachelors' buttons, to which attach a menu card by
a narrow white taffeta ribbon.</p>

<p>The refreshments should be numbered upon the menu
cards, and each guest be allowed to choose one number
each time the waitress passes around. The key to the
menu given should be held by the hostess and the waitress.</p>

<p>The following menu was recently used at a "Spinster
Tea" and created much merriment:</p>

<p>After all have partaken of refreshments the guests should
adjourn to the parlor where a circle may be formed, and,
beginning at the left, each spinster in turn may exhibit the
picture of her wooer, and relate her story. Two judges
may be chosen by lot to decide which is the prize story,
and a large frosted gingerbread heart may constitute the
prize.</p>

<p>Each guest on arriving should be presented with a white
card on which has been pasted a picture of General Washington.
These need not all be alike&mdash;in fact, it will increase
the interest in the cards if they are not; any picture
of our first President may be used. Small ones cut from
magazines will answer the purpose admirably. Beneath
the picture have the date, and through perforations at the
top of the cards run red, white and blue ribbon hangers.
On the reverse of each of the first thirteen cards given out
write the name of one of the thirteen original States; on
the next thirteen the capital of each of these States, and
on the next thirteen one of the principal cities in the States.
If the company is to be a large one the forty-five States of
the Union may be used instead of the original thirteen.</p>

<p>The company then forms into State groups&mdash;those holding
cards bearing the name of the State itself, its capital
and principal city&mdash;and each group agrees which product
of its State is most beneficial to the greatest number of
people. When a report is called for, a vote is taken from
all present as to which product is most essential to the
welfare of the nation as a whole. Three small bouquets
of red and white carnations tied with blue ribbon will
make appropriate rewards for the three supporters of the
State which wins distinction.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_156" id="Act_156"></a>TELEGRAM PARTY</h2>

<p>To interest guests who have a sense of humor and
thoroughly enjoy a little quick thinking you can easily invent
new games or adapt and add novel accessories to
some older idea, such as, for instance, "A Telegram
Party."</p>

<p>For this party write your invitations on telegram blanks,
and let your refreshments be served not by a maid (who
never enjoys extra work), but by one or more boys dressed
as telegraph messengers. They will delight in their responsibility
and will help you in many ways.</p>

<p>Let the boys also pass to each person a pencil and a
telegram blank, on which are to be written ten letters,
dictated at random by ten guests in turn. These letters
each player must manage to use as the initials of ten words
following in such order as to form an intelligible telegram.
None of these initials can be used for address or signature,
but otherwise no limit is placed upon the ingenuity of the
writer.</p>

<p>Then let the messengers collect the blanks, and after the
hostess has read all the amusing results let a vote be taken
for the cleverest message and a prize be awarded to the
sender.</p>

<p>Of course, the entertainment can be extended by writing
any number of telegrams or varied by requiring that
each set of telegrams refer to some assigned subject.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_157" id="Act_157"></a>TENNIS SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Write invitations on small white cardboard racquets.
Decorate the walls with tennis racquets and nets. Have
tennis racquets hung from each chandelier, and stretch a
large net across the room. Place in this net red and white
racquets of pasteboard, each tied to several yards of red
and white ribbon, and have them all tangled up. The object
is to wind up the string on the racquets, and secure as
many as possible without breaking the ribbon. The committee
should wear red belts with seven red streamers,
each containing a letter, and spelling the word "welcome."
Place welcome mottoes about the room and pinned upon
the racquets and nets. Red and white flowers of all kinds
can be used for decorations. Take small pasteboard
racquets, write quotations on, cut in half and give one-half
to the ladies and the other half to the gentlemen, and have
them match the quotations.</p>

<p>Refreshments can be passed in regular tennis racquets; in
summer, lemonade and wafers, or in winter, hot coffee and
cake.</p>

<p>Red and white decorated racquets can be given the guests
as they leave, for souvenirs.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_158" id="Act_158"></a>TEN VIRGINS (SACRED PLAY)</h2>

<p>Select ten young ladies who are good singers&mdash;six
sopranos and four altos. Divide into two groups, three
sopranos and two altos in each group. Have all dress in
long white robes and each carry a candle. Five should
have lighted candles and five not lighted. Have all behind
a curtain and before they appear have the whole ten
sing the hymn, "Be robed and ready when the bridegroom
comes." This can be found in any sacred song
book. Have a small room curtained off on one end of
platform. While singing the last verse, "We'll all go
forth to meet Him when He comes," the five with candles
lighted will march forth from behind the curtain and pass
across the platform into the small room. They go in and
the door is shut. The other five virgins come forth with
<i>no light</i> and pass across the platform silently, and knock at
the door, but they cannot get in. The five foolish virgins
then sing, "Oh, let us in, the night is dark and chill,"
and the five wise virgins who have passed in will answer,
using the chorus of the same hymn, "Too late, too late,
ye cannot enter now." This is found in Methodist
Hymnal, No. 375. The five foolish virgins ask the questions
contained in each verse and the five wise ones answer
with the "Too late."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_159" id="Act_159"></a>THANKSGIVING DAY DECORATIONS</h2>

<p>Great cornstalks, with the husk merely turned back to
show the yellow ear, are extremely effective. A huge
bunch of these on either side of the drawing-room door
will take the place of palms. They may also be placed at
the entrance to the dining-room, their sentinel-like appearance
making them charming as a doorway decoration.
Here and there great pumpkins, hollowed out to admit of
the flower-pot with its growing green, make unique jardinires.
A bunch of corn, where the ear is red, tied by
means of a bow of yellow ribbon to the chandelier, admits
of the same suggestion as the mistletoe of Christmas time,
and makes a pretty spot of color, besides being the cause
of much quiet fun.</p>

<p>A pretty feature is to have a pumpkin table brought in
during the refreshments and hold a guessing contest, which
gives an opportunity for much merriment and for the giving
of prizes to the lucky guessers.</p>

<p>This table should be arranged as follows: Upon a small,
highly polished table (mahogany is perhaps the richest in
effect), place a dainty, embroidered centrepiece, and set
upon this a large pumpkin, either on a silver dish or resting
directly on the white linen. This pumpkin should be
hollowed out, as the others, leaving only its yellow shell,
the pumpkin holding an assortment of fruit, luscious and
beautiful&mdash;highly polished red-cheeked apples, oranges, bananas
and grapes; trailing here and there among them a
few red leaves, or if they can be obtained, a spray of wild
clematis, of bitter-sweet, or of smilax.</p>

<p>The guests are told that underneath the fruit lies something
suggestive of nature's ways, and therefore of the occasion
and that they are to guess what it may be and how
much of it there may be.</p>

<p>The guesses will be many and varied. The fruit-dish
may be passed, the fruit disposed of, and underneath will
be found the pumpkin's seeds, which have been gathered
together. The prize for the guest that guesses the nearest
can be a little horn-of-plenty drinking glass. If one wishes
to give souvenirs of the occasion, charming little pencils
can be obtained that have the lead appearing from a
miniature ear of corn. This feature, however, is quite unnecessary.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_160" id="Act_160"></a>THANKSGIVING FOOTBALL DINNER</h2>

<p>The following is a description of a novel dinner recently
given a party of twelve football enthusiasts on Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p>While the ladies were up-stairs removing their wraps, a
maid came in with a tray on which were six wishbones,
each having tied to it a knot of ribbon of one of the different
college colors. Of these they were to take their
choice, according to the college or university they preferred.
Meanwhile the gentlemen down-stairs had been
presented with ribbon rosettes, and as these matched the
ribbons on the wishbones they easily found the ladies
whom they were to take in to dinner.</p>

<p>When the company entered the dining-room they found
that the decorations were in perfect harmony with the character
of the game which they had just witnessed. Chrysanthemums,
which are considered a necessary accompaniment
of a football game, were everywhere. A yellow
jardinire filled with ragged beauties in red and bronze
stood in the centre of the table, while a single long-stemmed
flower was laid beside each plate. There were
also chrysanthemums in vases on the mantel and sideboard.
The favors, or "mascots," of the dinner were small turkey-gobblers
of papier-mch containing the bonbons.</p>

<p>A feature of the dinner enjoyed almost as much as the
feast itself was the novel form of the menus. These were
written on two opposite pages of dainty booklets, the outside
covers of which were decorated with characteristic
football sketches accompanied by appropriate quotations.
These were so unique and apropos to the occasion that
each guest carried his home as a souvenir when he left at
the end of the evening's entertainment. Instead of being
separated into the usual courses, the menu was divided,
like a football game, into a first and second half, with an
intermission between, and was arranged to read somewhat
like a football program, giving in outline the particulars of
a game, the various terms and expressions in which described
the names of the viands. The following is an illustration,
except that in the original the names of the different
articles were omitted, a word in parenthesis giving a
hint where the meaning seemed doubtful:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">First Half</span></p>

<p>I. The spectators arrive and discuss the "points"
(blue) of the game.</p>

<p class="center">Blue Points</p>

<p>II. A tally-ho "bowls" in with the football team, said
to be "superior." The players enter the field with great
"celerity," the small boys enthusiastically declaring them
to be "crackers."</p>

<p class="center">Celery<span class="i2">Soup</span><span class="i2">Crackers</span></p>

<p>III. Play begins with "a fair catch taken on the fly."</p>

<p class="center">Fish</p>

<p>IV. A "foul (fowl) tackle."</p>

<p class="center">Turkey</p>

<p>"Pease" follows a "runner," but "Murphy" interferes
and "beats" him off.</p>

<p class="center">Peas<span class="i2">Squash</span><span class="i2">Potatoes</span><span class="i2">Beets</span></p>

<p>V. The game at the end of the first half is distinguished
by the fine playing of the "backs" (canvas).</p>

<p class="center">Canvasback Ducks</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Intermission</span></p>

<p>During the intermission the "heads" of several players,
young and green, bruised in the mix-up, receive a "dressing"
down.</p>

<p class="center">
Lettuce Salad</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Second Half</span></p>

<p>I. The wedge, or V-shaped, play is tried.</p>

<p class="center">Pie&mdash;Mince and Pumpkin</p>

<p>II. Followed by disastrous results, necessitating a call
for "sponge" and "ice."</p>

<p class="center">Sponge Cake<span class="i2">Ice Cream</span></p>

<p>III. The "fruits" of faithful training are manifest,
A "bunch of purples" go down before a single "orange."
"Bartlett" and "Nellis," a fine pair (pear), become
"candidates" for great honor, "raisin'" cheers of delight
from the spectators by circling the ends, who are "nut"
what they are "cracked" up to be.</p>

<p class="center">Fruit&mdash;Grapes<span class="i2">Oranges</span><span class="i2">Pears</span><span class="i2">Candied Dates<br />
Raisins</span><span class="i2">Nuts</span></p>

<p>IV. The cup is presented.</p>

<p class="center">Coffee</p>

<p>V. Everybody leaves the grounds.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the above may seem a little far-fetched to an
authority on football, the guests were not over-critical,
and the novel menu proved a great source of entertainment,
keeping them wondering and speculating between the
courses as to what was coming next. Some of the guests
supposed the "bruised heads" to be those of the cabbage,
it having apparently escaped their minds that there was
such a thing as head-lettuce. Others failed to see the connection
between squash and "runner" until reminded of
the fact that squash grows on a vine running along the
ground, while a smile went around the table as one by one,
after concluding that coffee was referred to in "The cup is
presented," discovered, also, the double meaning in the
final words of the menu, "Everybody leaves the
grounds."</p>

<p>A number of things served on the table, such as cranberries,
jellies, olives, etc., were not named in the menu,
owing to the difficulty of expressing them in football language.</p>

<p>After dinner there was much fun and merriment over
pulling the wishbones, the ladies having offered to break
theirs with the gentlemen attending them at dinner. Later
the guests gathered around the open fireplace, cracking
nuts, telling stories, and having a good time generally.
When the time came for them to depart they voted the
Thanksgiving dinner of which they had just partaken
the most unique to which they had ever sat down.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_161" id="Act_161"></a>THANKSGIVING SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>How surprised every one was at the changed appearance
of the Sunday-school room! All the chairs had been removed
and at various places stood great shocks of corn.
Upon the wall were hung red berries and bright-hued
autumn leaves, garlands of which may be easily made if
the leaves are gathered as they fall, waxed, pressed, and
strung on strong threads. In the centre of the room was
arranged a large semicircular divan made of pew-cushions
covered with dark, richly-colored draperies. There were
a number of sofa-pillows heaped upon the divan. The
room was dark save for the light which glimmered from
hideous-faced pumpkin lanterns.</p>

<p>The committee in charge welcomed the guests and invited
them to be seated in the charmed circle. The first thing
that met their gaze was an immense pile of corn on the cob.
Over this, standing on three legs, was a goblin pumpkin
with three pairs of glaring eyes, three noses and three large
mouths. A hush fell upon the company, while here and
there could be heard a suppressed giggle. Suddenly a
chorus of girls' voices broke out in a bright autumn song
to enliven the drooping spirits of the guests.</p>

<p>No sooner had their fears been somewhat allayed than a
spectral figure approached from behind a curtain and sat
down by the heap of corn. All held their breath as it
slowly reached out its hand and pulled an ear of corn from
the pile, gazed at a tag which was fastened to it by a ribbon,
read the name of some one who was present, and
threw that person the ear of corn, demanding in a deep,
thrilling voice, "A ghost story." It is needless to describe
the quaking and shivering while the story was being told.
The dashing piano solo which followed was fully appreciated.</p>

<p>A second ghost story was demanded in like manner as
the first, after which came singing, more stories, and music.
Then one of the girls, who could recite well, stood facing
the company, with a background of curtains, and gave
Whittier's poem, "The Pumpkin" When she reached
the last stanza the curtains back of her were drawn, as if
by spirits, disclosing a long table covered with a snowy
cloth, upon which were piles of doughnuts, pumpkin pies,
cheese and cups of steaming coffee. Every one gave an
exclamation of surprise at the sight, and refreshments were
served amidst much fun and laughter.</p>

<p>The sociable closed with gifts of a pie apiece to each
person contributing to the entertainment, and an ear of
corn, tied with bright ribbon, to each guest.</p>

<p>In order to have the ghost stories a success the committee
arranging the program had selected them beforehand.</p>

<p>A great deal of the success of the entertainment was due
to the fact that its nature had been kept secret, and, curiosity
having been aroused, an unusually large number of
people attended.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_162" id="Act_162"></a>TRANSPLANTING TREES</h2>

<p>Pass slips of paper around with the names of different
trees, all in capital letters, but not spelled in order; for
instance, Y-H-O-K-R-I-C, which when transplanted will
spell the name Hickory. A suitable prize can be given
the one who succeeds in transplanting the greatest number
of trees.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_164" id="Act_164"></a>TREE PARTY</h2>

<p>For a June entertainment nothing could be more suitable
than a tree party, for at this season the new leaves are all
out and everything looks fresh and green. Trim the house
with branches and blossoms, having as many varieties of
trees represented as possible. When all the guests have
arrived, give to each one a strip of cardboard (having a
pencil tied to it with a bit of green ribbon) upon which
are written the following questions for them to answer:</p>

</table>

<p>Then the following game may be played:</p>

<p>Pin a slip, containing the name of some tree, on the
back of each person present.</p>

<p>Questions may be asked concerning it, which will give
a clue to the wearer, who is to guess the tree he is supposed
to represent.</p>

<p>As fast as each one is guessed, the slip is taken off the
back and pinned on the breast. Allow fifteen minutes for
each person to write an original poem on the tree he represents.
Judges are appointed to select the best poem, and
a suitable prize can be awarded.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_165" id="Act_165"></a>TREE POOL</h2>

<p>That the guests may choose partners, give out cards of
red, green, yellow, and brown cardboard cut in the shape
of leaves,&mdash;maple, elm, oak, etc. There should, of course,
be but two leaves of the same shape and color, one of each
being passed to the ladies, the corresponding ones to the
men. The game is played in the usual way where there
is a pool of letters, except that the words made must be
only the names of trees or shrubs. For those who may
not be altogether familiar with the game, the rules are that
each one in turn draws a letter from the pool, then tries
by transposing one of his opponent's words to use this
letter, and so make a new word for himself. Plurals are
not considered new words. If one cannot use the letter
to draw from his opponent's, or in his own list, it is thrown
back, and the turn passes to the next. If, however, the
letter is used, the player has another turn. When either
couple at the head table have made ten words, the bell is
rung and the guests score and progress as in any other
game.</p>

<p>When supper is served, have the table decorated with a
plant standing in the centre, and from this to each corner
of the table have a row of Noah's Ark trees, which can
be purchased at any toy shop. Stand one of these on
each of the plates as they are passed to the guests. They
will make very attractive souvenirs of the occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_166" id="Act_166"></a>TROLLEY PARTY</h2>

<p>The guests invited to our trolley party were twenty in
number. When all had assembled, cards with pencils
attached were given them, after which the hostess announced
that the trip would take half an hour, that the
conductor would ring his bell for start and finish, but that
the guests must prove their familiarity with the names of
the streets, which were represented on cards scattered
through the rooms&mdash;pinned to curtains, table-covers, pincushions,
etc. Carnations were given to the one guessing
correctly the greatest number of streets, a tiny bank and
a new penny to the one having the least.</p>

<p>The cards were as follows:</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">A Trolley Ride&mdash;St. Louis to Kirkwood</span></p>

<ol>
<li>Abraham's wife.</li>

<li>What idols' feet are often made of.</li>

<li>Stop here when hungry.</li>

<li>Always owns a goose.</li>

<li>Dear to our hearts though sometimes a "Rip."</li>

<li>Brought lightning from the clouds.</li>

<li>A part of a door and what doors are usually made of.</li>

<li>A sombre color.</li>

<li>Of cherry-tree fame.</li>

<li>A direction of the compass and a preacher.</li>

<li>The side of a tiny stream.</li>

<li>One of the discoverers of Pike's Peak.</li>

<li>A great turn.</li>

<li>Associated with the lower regions.</li>

<li>The highest point.</li>

<li>What most housewives do on Monday.</li>

<li>A famous summer resort.</li>

<li>What the preacher who lisped said to the sinner.</li>

<li> Green, and dear to girlish hearts.</li>

<li>Makes a quick fire.</li>
</ol>
<p>The names of the streets represented were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sarah.</li>
<li>Clay.</li>
<li>Berry Road.</li>
<li>Taylor.</li>
<li>Jefferson.</li>
<li>Franklin.</li>
<li>Lockwood.</li>
<li>Gray.</li>
<li>Washington.</li>
<li>Westminster.</li>
<li>Edgebrook.</li>
<li>Clark.</li>
<li>Big Bend.</li>
<li>Sulphur.</li>
<li>Summit.</li>
<li>Wash.</li>
<li>Newport.</li>
<li>Prather.</li>
<li>Olive.</li>
<li>Pine.</li>
</ol>

<p>This same idea could be carried out in connection with
the streets of any other town.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_167" id="Act_167"></a>UNIQUE VALENTINE PARTY</h2>

<p>The invitations requested that each guest appear in costume
and masked. This was the keynote of the affair.
An early lunch was planned, as they were to choose
partners while still masked, and naturally they would wish
to remove their masks after that form of the entertainment
had flagged a little.</p>

<p>The rooms were decorated with valentines which had
accumulated in the household through fourteen years and
others prepared for the purpose.</p>

<p>After the choice of partners, masks were removed, and
all marched to the dining-room, keeping time to a pretty
march.</p>

<p>It being a birthday party, the ever new feature, the
birthday cake, with its candles, graced the centre of the
table, the cake being white decorated with red hearts and
red candles. Three kinds of small cakes and wafers (all
heart-shaped), a plate of each at either end of the table,
made up that part of the refreshments. Cocoa in small
cups and ice cream in heart-shaped molds completed the
repast. Confectionery in the predominating color and
shape was also on the table.</p>

<p>The table decorations consisted of red carnations, ferns
and smilax, and were added to by the souvenirs which
were laid at the left of each plate. These were prepared
by our family artist for the occasion, and were red, heart-shaped
affairs with gold borders, in the centre a small
sketch in oil, below a line of poetry, and each one numbered.
These were connected by ribbon (running to the
centre of the table) to buttonhole bouquets, carnations and
smilax, which with ferns formed the flat centrepiece. At
the ends as many as were convenient were arranged around
the end dishes. Much merriment was created by some
reading the lines on their souvenirs.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the table each guest adjusted the ribbon
about her neck, which brought the bouquet to its proper
place "across the heart." After returning to the parlors
the guests were requested to read the lines which they had
found upon their souvenirs, and of which some had been
wondering the meaning; by beginning with No. 1 and
reading in rotation a well-known poem was completed. As
you will see, this form of amusement, with the character
representations, goes far toward an evening's entertainment.
Young people consider a party incomplete
without a prize winning contest of some sort. The one I
will describe was adopted.</p>

<p>Pencils and slips of paper were distributed, each bearing
the name of a book or song, and numbered; then
pieces of drawing paper were handed around, the first
slips being collected, and each person was requested to
make a drawing representing the book or song, and putting
his number on it. These were gathered and pinned
up for exhibition. The best drawing won a prize. Then
the person that, upon inspecting the drawings, could give
correctly the names of the most books or songs they represented
(more paper being passed for this purpose) received
a prize.</p>

<p>The remainder of the evening was filled in by music,
singing and games of the guests' own choosing. When
the time of departure came, all wished they might enjoy
it "all over again."</p>

<h2><a name="Act_168" id="Act_168"></a>UNIVERSITY LUNCHEON</h2>

<p>A Yale luncheon given last Christmastide was a brilliant
success. The ideas may be utilized for the entertainment
of students from any college, merely changing the colors.</p>

<p>Our decision was to have no flowers, not even a palm,
and to keep the entire house in harmony of coloring. Fortunately
for our scheme, every room had a quiet gray or
bluish paper, and in carpets, furniture and hangings there
was not a touch of color that would clash with the blue of
Yale. Our first bit of luck was the loan of a huge bundle
of Yale flags and bunting from the College Men's club.
A flag, with a great white "Yale" on it, we stretched
across one end of the sitting-room, another, as immense as
a campaigning banner, draped the west wall of the dining-room.
The stairs were garlanded with blue bunting, and
all over the house fluttered little class flags bearing dates
that ran from '80 to '05. We allowed bunches of mistletoe
tucked cunningly under gas fixtures. Holly was out
of the question: it would have suggested Harvard.</p>

<p>Serving luncheon at one was an innovation, but an excellent
one. When the dishes were cleared away the
anxiety was over, and the hostess moved about among her
guests without a thought of a meal to be served at the end
of the games. We set ten small tables, three in the dining-room,
four in the sitting-room, two in the parlor and one
in the hall. The tables were snowily linened, there were
doilies in blue and white, and the centrepiece on each table
was a glass dish filled with small bunches of splendid blue
and white grapes. There was nothing blue to be found in
the fruit or flower kingdom except these, and the coloring
was superb. All the dishes we used were handsome old-fashioned
willow ware, solid dark blue, or mottled blue
china.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_169" id="Act_169"></a>VALENTINE ENTERTAINMENT</h2>

<p>Two dozen couples make a very goodly company of
young folks for a pleasant little evening; therefore, send
out invitations to that number. The cards of invitation
might have on them, either in India ink or water-colors,
an arrow-pierced heart, a whole heart or a broken one;
even a cluster of them, like fishes on a string, according
to the pleasure of the hostess. For each of the twelve
young ladies invited, select a rle that she will impersonate;
for instance, we will say that the twelve characters
to be represented are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Queen of Hearts.</li>
<li>Gypsy.</li>
<li>Nun.</li>
<li>Bicycle Girl.</li>
<li>Summer Girl.</li>
<li>Colonial Girl.</li>
<li>Poster Girl.</li>
<li>Widow.</li>
<li>Old Maid.</li>
<li>Trained Nurse.</li>
<li>Columbia.</li>
<li>Valentine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Number twelve can be either a sentimental or a comic
character. If the latter, a good deal of amusement may
be derived by getting a younger brother or some mischievous
boy to represent this character. Have the young ladies
gather at the home of the hostess somewhat earlier than
the men present themselves, and when the latter have assembled
in the parlors pass a tray around to them containing
a dozen cards, on each of which is written a couplet.
These couplets are suggestive of the rles the young ladies
play, and each gentleman may select such a couplet as he
sees fit. When all the cards have been taken, the young
men in rotation read aloud the couplet each has chosen,
and after the reading of the couplet the one representing it
is brought into the parlor by the hostess and introduced to
the reader, who has thus chosen her as his valentine.</p>

<p>Among the pleasant features of the supper a "Valentine
cake" may be introduced with good effect. A nicely iced
cake, decorated with candy hearts having sentimental mottoes
on them, should be divided into twenty-four slices before
it is brought to the table. In the slices for the young
girls to draw make a small slit with the sharp blade of a
knife, and insert into the opening a slip of paper on which
is written the name of some young man who is present.</p>

<p>In those slices the men are to draw are such small articles
as denote the sort of wife Fate has chosen to be each one's
partner for life. Thus, a silver coin signifies wealth; a
scrap of silk, a fashionable wife; a penny, poverty; a tiny
spoon, a good housekeeper; a pen, a literary woman; a
small silver heart, a marriage for love; a small brush, an
artistic wife; a tiny mirror, a vain woman; a piece of
crape, a widow, etc.</p>

<p>First a young lady chooses a slice of cake, then the man
whose name she draws selects one and learns the kind of
life-partner he is to have. Much merriment may be derived
from such a cake.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_170" id="Act_170"></a>VALENTINE FUN</h2>

<p>This description of a Valentine entertainment will be
welcomed by those who desire novel and original ideas.</p>

<p>We were received in a room decorated with wreaths of
green, hung in festoons caught up at regular intervals by
ribbon streamers. From the centre of each wreath hung
hearts of parchment paper, tinted in blue and lettered in
gold, each bearing a number and a fate or fortune.</p>

<p>Suspended from a portire rod between the hall and reception
room were three hearts formed of heavy wire and
carefully entwined with evergreen; above each one was a
jingle. The first said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Blow your bubble right through here</p>
<p>And you'll be married before another year.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Above the second was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>To be engaged this very week</p>
<p>Number two is the one to take.</p>
</div></div>
<p>And the third had:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>A sad, an awful fate awaits the one who seeks me,</p>
<p>For he or she will ever a spinster or bachelor be.</p>
</div></div>
<p>On a small table near by was an immense bowl filled
with sparkling soapsuds, and also clay pipes decorated with
little blue hearts.</p>

<p>We first threw the bubbles off the pipes and then tried
to blow them through the hearts with pretty little fans
which were presented to us; none of us found this easy to
do, but it was lots of fun, even if after all our efforts we
saw our bubble float through number three instead of one
or two, where we meant it to go.</p>

<p>After this came a still merrier game. A low scrap-basket
was placed in the centre of the room, and the company
arranged into opposing parties, forming two half
circles around the basket. Cardboard hearts in two different
colors were given the sides, an equal number to
each side. We were then requested to try to throw them
in the basket, and all endeavored to do so, but found they
had a tantalizing way of landing on the floor.</p>

<p>When we had exhausted our cards those in the basket
were counted, and the side having the most of its own
color won the game.</p>

<p>After this a small blackboard was placed on an easel at
one end of the room, and we were each in turn blindfolded,
and handed a piece of chalk with which to draw an
outline of a heart, and to write our name in the centre;
the one doing the best to have a prize of a large candy
heart.</p>

<p>The partners for supper were chosen in a novel manner,
the men being numbered, and the names of the girls written
on slips of paper, rolled in clay in little pellets, then
dropped into a bowl of water; the one to rise first belonged
to the young man numbered one, and so on until
each had his Valentine.</p>

<p>A "Good Luck" supper was served in an adjoining
room. Directly over the table, suspended from the chandelier,
hung a floral horseshoe. In the centre of the table
and at each end were fairy lamps surrounded by smaller
horseshoes. The guest-cards were square envelopes, at
one side a painted horseshoe, and below, "When Good
Luck knocks at the door let him in and keep him there."
The souvenirs were clover-leaf stick pins, and everything
connected with the supper bore a symbol of good luck,
the bonbons, cakes, and sandwiches taking the forms of
either a clover-leaf or a horseshoe.</p>

<p>On opening the envelopes, we found an amusing valentine
illustrated by a pen-and-ink sketch, showing the artistic
skill of one of the members of the family.</p>

<p>After supper a tray, containing as many numbers as
there were guests, was passed, and we each took a heart
with a corresponding number from the decorations on the
wall and read aloud the fortune found there. These were
very clever, and some surprisingly appropriate.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_171" id="Act_171"></a>VALENTINE PARTY&mdash;DANISH</h2>

<p>The "Town Club" was surprised by receiving white cards
decorated with cherry-colored ribbon and Danish Flag inviting
them to a "Danish Valentine Party." The predominating
colors were cherry color and white, being the
Danish National Colors. Decorations of the house were of
cherry-colored and white hearts and vinter-gjaek (snowdrops),
the first Danish flower of the season. The hearts
were strung in the parlor, reception-room and dining-room.
The archway between parlor and reception-room was
draped with the American and Danish Flags. In the centre
of each room hung four large-sized hearts, cherry-colored
and white, with a gilt arrow thrust through. In the dining-room
the hearts were strung in the same way, the lamp
shade being of cherry-colored crepe paper. The table
was decorated with vinter-gjaek.</p>

<p>The girls wore short skirts and bodices of cherry-colored
cambric and white flannel blouses with full sleeves. The
hair was worn in two braids, crossed and tucked into the
fronts of the bodices with knots of vinter-gjaek fastened
into each braid just where it came over the shoulder.
The boys wore dark coats and trousers, with white vests.</p>

<p>At the door was placed a box for valentines; as each
guest came he dropped his valentine into the box with the
name of the person who was to receive it. First for
amusement was "Shadow Pictures," the guessing of each
boy's and girl's profile. White cards with numbers in
cherry ink and small cherry-colored pencils were passed to
each. As the shadow was thrown upon the sheet the name
was written after the number on the card. Prizes were
given for the most correct guesses. The girls' prize was a
cherry-colored satin pin cushion in the shape of a heart;
the boys', an earthen pig. Then small white cards were
passed tied with cherry-colored ribbon and vinter-gjaek,
each card containing a verse and below this the initials of
a name pricked out with a pin. By guessing the names
they stood for, each knew his or her valentine for the
evening. It was great fun. Lots were gjaeket (fooled).
The verse on the cards read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Sir Knight, would'st know thy lady's name,</p>
<p>These pin pricks tell thee whence I came."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then all were asked to the dining-room, where they
found the following supper awaiting them served in Danish
style:</p>

<table summary="Danish style Menu">
<tr>
<td>Coffee</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="tdr">Water</td>

<td class="tdr">Head-Cheese</td>

</table>

<p>Souvenirs&mdash;Three white candy hearts containing verses,
tied with cherry-colored ribbon.</p>

<p>After supper the valentines brought by the guests were
distributed. Music and a flashlight picture of the "Town
Club" completed the entertainment. Then all departed
with light hearts.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_172" id="Act_172"></a>VALENTINE SOCIABLE</h2>

<p>Invitations should be sent out for the 14th of February.
Each guest is requested to bring a valentine, and as they
enter the room, they should drop them into a basket which
should be ready to receive them. These can be sent later
to some poor school or mission to be given out to poor
children, who otherwise would get none. A small room
can be fitted up for a studio, and as the guests arrive, they
are invited into this room to have their pictures taken.</p>

<p>A committee should be appointed to do this work.
This can be done by having the shadow of the head in
profile thrown on a sheet of paper tacked to the wall.
The artist then sketches it with pencil and cuts it out.
After all have arrived and have had their pictures taken,
paper and pencil are passed around, and the guests are
asked to guess the identity of each picture.</p>

<p>The pictures are then given to the owners as keepsakes.
A nice idea is for the gentlemen to write a valentine verse
on the portraits of the ladies, or make up some comic
poetry. A sale of hearts is also a cute idea.</p>

<p>Buy small hearts with a valentine couplet on each; these
being read aloud, each heart is to be sold to the person
who first completes its couplet; for instance, "'Tis better
to have loved and lost," the person finishing it as "than
never to have loved at all."</p>

<p>The one guessing the greatest number of couplets can be
given a small box of heart-shaped candies.</p>

<p>Partners can be chosen for supper by having each lady
write her name on a slip of paper, and putting all the slips
into a hat; each gentleman will take to supper the one
whose name he draws from the hat.</p>

<p>A pretty souvenir can be given each guest in the form of
a small heart-shaped valentine.</p>

<p>Refreshments can be suggestive of the day also. They
can consist of sandwiches cut in heart-shape, tied with red
baby ribbon, bright-red apples, cherry ice, lady fingers,
kisses and small heart-shaped candies. A card on each dish
could carry out the idea in the following manner:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>Sandwiches&mdash;"Heart bread."</li>
<li>Apples&mdash;"Love apples."</li>
<li>Cherry Ice&mdash;"Frozen heart's blood."</li>
<li>Lady Fingers&mdash;"Love's caresses."</li>
<li>Kisses&mdash;"Lovers' sweets."</li>
<li>Candies&mdash;"Love's sweet compound."</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Act_174" id="Act_174"></a>VEGETABLE PARTY</h2>

<p>Over the table was an Italian green-grocer's sign, and
the smiling attendants were dressed to represent Italian
women. The table was loaded with fruits and vegetables,
all made of tissue paper. The stock included pumpkins,
squashes, cabbages, cauliflower, curly lettuce, beets, carrots,
potatoes, tomatoes, radishes, oranges, and grapes.
The vegetables sold for five or ten cents, according to size
and contents, for each contained a prize. The radishes
and grapes were candies covered with the proper shade of
paper and tied in bunches.</p>

<p>There was enough mystery about the contents of these
artificial vegetables and fruits to make them sell. One
person might open a cucumber and find a child's handkerchief
rolled within, but if a neighbor bought one, hoping
to secure a handkerchief, he would be quite as likely to
find a china doll. The proceeds of this sale were
donated to charity.</p>

<p>A slip of paper entitled "Vegetables in Disguise" was
passed to each guest, and twenty-five minutes allotted for
puzzling out the answers. The following is the list the
paper contained:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>A pronoun preceded and followed by a preposition. (Onion)</li>

<li>A painful projection. (Corn)</li>

<li>Hard to get out of. (Maize [maze])</li>

<li>What vegetables should see a great deal, and why?
(Potatoes. They have so many eyes)</li>

<li>A basement and a question. (Celery [cellar-why])</li>

<li>Every good Chinaman has my first. My second is to overload.
(Cucumber [queue-cumber])</li>

<li>A bivalve and a vegetable growth. (Oyster plant)</li>

<li>Normal, and a very small piece. (Parsnip)</li>

<li>A small waste. (Leek [leak])</li>

<li>A letter. (Pea [p])</li>

<li>A boy, a letter, and a part of the body? (Tomato [Tom-a-toe])</li>

<li>Yielding water, and connections? (Pumpkin)</li>

<li>To crush. (Squash)</li>

<li>A purple part of the year, and sick. (Lentil [Lent-ill])</li>

<li>A tour on your wheel, and years. (Spinach [spin-age])</li>

<li>Hot stuff. (Pepper)</li>

<li>An English dignity, and a platter. (Radish [R. A. dish])</li>

<li>A hen. (Egg plant)</li>

<li>Tramps. (Beets)</li>
</ul>

<p>The supper, as one would expect at a vegetable party,
consisted of vegetarian dishes only, but it was surprising
to find how attractive and how palatable these were.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_175" id="Act_175"></a>WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES</h2>

<p>In planning for anniversaries there are many and unique
ways in which they may be carried out. Everything that
accompanies the anniversary being celebrated should be
used. Always use a decided color and try to carry out
the color scheme in the refreshments, the decorations, and
the costumes. There are many suitable suggestions in the
book from which to choose, in the way of both decoration
and entertainment, besides the following.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">First Anniversary&mdash;Cotton Wedding</span></p>

<p>The invitations for the cotton wedding may be written
in ink on well-starched cotton cloth. Cut the pieces to
fit regular-sized envelopes. You may request the guests
to wear cotton costumes, if you wish, to add to the effect.
Decorate the rooms with cheese-cloth of several colors
gracefully festooned about the walls, and with the Southern
cotton-balls if you can get them. The married couple
may stand under a canopy made of wire covered with
cotton wadding to represent snow, and wear cotton
costumes, and the wife may carry a bouquet of cotton
flowers. Artificial flowers made of cotton may be used,
too, for decoration. Cover the refreshment table with
cheese-cloth, and have place-cards written on prettily
decorated pieces of starched muslin. You could have a
Spider Hunt for an appropriate entertainment. For this,
as you probably know, you provide balls of cotton twine,
and wind the twine all over the house. The guests have to
untangle their respective balls, and wind them up until
they come to the end of the string, where a gift is discovered.
The gifts should be pretty conceits made of
cotton&mdash;shoe-bags or work bags of pretty cretonne for the
women, and picture frames of cretonne for the men, etc.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Second Anniversary&mdash;Paper Wedding</span></p>

<p>The second year is celebrated as a paper wedding.
There are many ways a house can be decorated with
paper. Pretty colored paper shades can be made for all
the gas jets (or lamp chimneys), flower-pots can be trimmed
with fancy crepe paper, butterflies can be made from stiff
colored paper, doilies can be designed from fancy paper,
and paper napkins can be used in many ways. Whatever
is used for refreshments paper napkins can be placed on
each dish under the food; tumblers can be wrapped
around with paper and tied with a dainty little ribbon.
Plenty of paper flowers can be used for decoration. The
tablecloth may be of paper, edged with paper lace, the
centrepiece of paper roses, the candle-shades composed
of their petals, while the ices may be served in boxes held
in the hearts of paper roses. For entertainment, large
mottoes containing paper caps may be distributed. These
should be put on, and with their assumption a character
impersonated by each wearer appropriate to the headgear.
The guesses are recorded in paper booklets and the person
most successful may receive a prize&mdash;a book or any paper
trifle.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Fourth Anniversary&mdash;Leather Wedding</span></p>

<p>The fourth year is observed as a leather wedding. Invitations
sent out for this anniversary can have a small
piece of leather enclosed in envelope. A unique idea is
to have a leather saddle hung in the centre of the room,
with a leather whip and riding gloves. As souvenirs small
pieces of leather with the date of the wedding, also the
date of the anniversary, stamped or written upon them,
and tied with white baby ribbon, may be distributed.
Small leather calendars can be made, also heart-shaped
leather pen-wipers with small paintings on them. Appropriate
presents for the married couple would be leather
purses, hand-bags, shoes, satchels, pocketbooks, lunch
boxes, traveling cases, etc., and do not forget a leather
smoking case for the host.</p>

<p>A burnt-leather box or basket filled with yellow flowers
or growing ferns would not be ill-adapted for a centrepiece
for the refreshment table, and leatherette receptacles, if
made in sections tied together with ribbons matching the
flowers, would be pretty for the bonbons, cakes and salted
nuts.</p>

<p>The place-cards may be of leather with the names in
heavy gilt lettering.</p>

<p>A game or contest is usually enjoyed, and the award of
a trifling prize to the victor makes a pleasant climax to the
evening's fun. In this case the article should, of course,
be of leather.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Fifth Anniversary&mdash;Wooden Wedding</span></p>

<p>A description is given of an actual wooden wedding
anniversary celebrated recently. The invitations were
printed on paper that looked like wood. In fact
it looked so much like it that it could hardly
be told from wood. For decorations as much real
wood was utilized as possible. In one large archway
were hung twelve wooden plates, each with a painting
on, and joined with white ribbon. Twelve young ladies
served on the reception committee and the twelve plates
were given them as souvenirs before they departed. In
another archway there was a toothpick curtain which attracted
much attention. This was made on silk cord with
the toothpicks tied about two inches apart, crossways, with
a small loop in the cord. They were draped back and tied
with a bunch of silk cord. In the small doorways were
clothes-pin curtains. A large wire bell, covered with shavings
and goldenrod, hung from a canopy of the same, under
which the bride and groom stood to receive their
guests.</p>

<p>A large wooden flower-stand was placed in the reception
hall and it was banked with goldenrod and cut flowers,
with a large palm on top shelf. Several wooden bowls and
baskets of goldenrod and cut flowers were scattered about
the house. On the mantels, stands, table, sideboard, and
piano, were large palms and goldenrod. All the chairs
had been moved out of the house, except in the dining-room,
where they were arranged around the wall. In the
centre of the room was the polished table, with neat doilies,
and for a centrepiece was a large yellow cake with the
figure "5" in wood. This cake stood on a high cake-stand
and around the edge of the stand were a row of
clothes-pins, the kind with a spring, and a row of toothpicks
sticking all around the edge of the cake. On two
corners of the table were little wooden shoes filled with cut
flowers, and on the two diagonally opposite corners were
large apples stuck full of toothpicks. The guests were
seated in the dining-room for refreshments and as soon as
it was filled, the reception committee closed it with a large
rope of goldenrod across the doorway. For refreshments
ice cream and cake were served on wooden plates with
wooden spoons. The ice cream was made to look like
wood, the caterer using a mixture of vanilla, chocolate,
bisque and lemon flavors. The different kinds of cake
were also made to look like different kinds of wood, such
as walnut, oak, cherry, and so forth. The souvenirs were
large wooden butter moulds on which were printed the year
of marriage and the year of celebration. An orchestra of
eight pieces played all through the evening, under a canopy
of white cloth on the porch, the porch being carpeted
and curtained like a room.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Seventh Anniversary&mdash;Woolen Wedding</span></p>

<p>The woolen wedding comes with the seventh anniversary.
The material is not effective, but the invitations may
be worked in crewels on perforated Bristol-board.</p>

<p>The "cobweb party" might be revived, using colored
yarns instead of cords, and placing a "fortune" as well as
a favor at the end of each. Some unfortunate swain
might, perhaps, find a huge worsted mitten, guided in his
choice of yarn by one in the secret to insure its selection
by a man.</p>

<p>On the refreshment table a large wedding-cake crowned
by a "Bo-peep" doll with her flock of toy sheep would
suggest the "woolly" idea.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Tenth Anniversary&mdash;Tin Wedding</span></p>

<p>These wedding invitations can be written or printed,
and sent out ten days beforehand, either enclosing a piece
of tin, or wrapped in tin foil.</p>

<p>The bride and groom should receive their guests, the
bride carrying her bouquet in a tin funnel. The groom
can wear a small tin horn in his buttonhole with a small
bouquet. The author intends to celebrate her tin wedding
this fall, and this is what she intends to have.</p>

<p>For refreshments, will serve coffee in tin cups, with tin
spoons, and dainty sandwiches on tin plates; will pass water
in a tin pail, using a tin dipper. All refreshments will be
passed in tin pans, the waiters will use tin coffee pots to refill
the coffee cups. For a centrepiece for the table, will
use a large tin cake pan, with an opening in the centre, in
which a small fish horn can be placed, the cake pan and
fish horn both being filled with flowers. Shall decorate
the rooms with tin as far as possible. In one archway shall
use tin plates tied together with ribbon, a small hole being
punched in the plates for the purpose. This will form a
curtain for one archway. In another archway shall use tin
cups for the same purpose. Tin candlesticks can be used,
if one is fortunate enough to have them. Wire toasters
tied with ribbon can be hung on the walls to hold photographs.
Small tin spoons tied with ribbons can be given
as souvenirs, being passed around by the waiters, in a tin
dust pan.</p>

<p>Potted plants can be set in tin pails, and tin cans can be
used for bouquets. A tin wash basin can be passed for a
finger bowl. Tin foil can also be used with which to decorate.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Twelfth Anniversary&mdash;Linen Wedding</span></p>

<p>The invitations are written on squares of linen in indelible
ink, and the name cards are also of linen. Linen is
used freely about the rooms, linen lace working into decorative
schemes most effectively. The flax flower is, of
course, conspicuous whenever it can be obtained. The
artificial flower may be used in many places, as well as the
natural blossoms. The centrepiece, doilies, etc., used on
the table should be embroidered with flax flowers in natural
colors.</p>

<p>While the guests are at supper an old-fashioned spinning
wheel should be brought into the parlors in readiness for a
spinning contest, which may be conducted as described in
the entertainment, "A Spinning Party."</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Fifteenth Anniversary&mdash;Crystal Wedding</span></p>

<p>The invitations may be decorated with drawings of
small hand-mirrors, tumblers, etc., and for the ornamentation
of the house every conceivable kind of glass vessel
and mirror may be used. In the table decorations cut or
pressed glass should be prominent. In the centre of the
table a small mirror might be placed, with a large glass
bowl upon it filled with flowers. Red carnations with red
candle-shades make a very effective color scheme for the
crystal background. Little cakes with red icing, red bonbons,
and red place cards may also be used. The refreshments
should be served on glass dishes, the waiters
using glass trays if possible. Tiny glass bottles each containing
a red carnation and a sprig of smilax make very
appropriate souvenirs. Should the bride desire an appropriate
gown for the occasion, it may be trimmed with
quantities of glass beads or the glass drops from a chandelier.
Those who assist in receiving might also be similarly
garbed.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Twentieth Anniversary&mdash;China Wedding</span></p>

<p>A good idea for a china wedding would be to have a
course dinner and display all one's china. Use china
wherever it can be used instead of silver, glass, or other
dishes. Have plants and flowers displayed in china. A
unique idea would be to give each guest a tiny china cup
and saucer as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Any of the parlor entertainments or contests described
in this volume may be used to pass the time pleasantly
either before or after the dinner.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Twenty-Fifth Anniversary&mdash;Silver Wedding</span></p>

<p>The invitations to a silver wedding should be headed by
the two eventful dates printed in silver.</p>

<p>For the decorations, use any flowers which may be in
season, surrounding the mirrors and pictures as far as possible
with a framework of green spangled with silver.
Cover all the lamps and gas shades with white crepe paper
flecked here and there with silver, and suspend balls covered
with silver paper from the chandeliers.</p>

<p>Let the daughters in the family, and the granddaughters
if there be any, wear gowns of simplest white, with draperies
of silver tinsel. If there happen to be any grandchildren
it would be well to have them distribute the favors,
which may be bouquets of flowers tied with white ribbons.</p>

<p>The refreshments should be served shortly after the
guests arrive. A suitable way to announce that supper is
served will be to have the wedding march played, when
the bride and groom of the evening may be requested to
lead the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>The supper-table should be lighted with white candles in
silver candelabra, and the snowy tablecloth be crossed
diagonally with white satin ribbon edged with silver.
Upon a pretty centrepiece of silver-spangled tulle may be
placed a silver or glass bowl containing twenty-five white
roses. Dishes of white cakes and candies, and old-fashioned
mottoes covered with silver paper may be scattered
plentifully about the table. The large cake should be
decorated in white and silver, and placed upon a silver
dish in front of the bride of twenty-five years ago, who
alone should be permitted to cut it.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the presents which may be sent in
honor of a silver wedding, but no guest need be deterred
from appearing because of her inability to send a present;
her good wishes will please the host and hostess quite as
well as an elaborate gift.</p>

<p>Pretty souvenirs of a silver wedding are bookmarks of
white satin ribbon, upon each one of which is printed in
silver the name of the guest and the dates of the anniversary
he or she has been helping to celebrate.</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Fiftieth Anniversary&mdash;Golden Wedding</span></p>

<p>Invitations to a golden wedding should be written or
printed on golden hued cards. Let the bride wear a dress
of golden hue, or, if she dislikes such bright colors, let her
use plenty of yellow flowers in her hair and on her dress.
The groom should also wear yellow flowers. Two armchairs
decorated with straw might be used for the seats of
honor. Have the home decorated with goldenrod if in
season, if not, any yellow flower can be used; if the season
for sunflowers, they are very pretty for decoration.
Let those who help serve wear yellow dresses or plenty of
yellow flowers. A large yellow cake could be used for a
centrepiece, banked with yellow flowers; use brass candlesticks
with yellow candles. Plenty of flowers or yellow
paper should be used for the gas jets, lamp shades and
picture frames. Refreshments might consist of yellow
cake, lemonade, and yellow candy. Pretty souvenirs
would be a yellow carnation for each guest.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_176" id="Act_176"></a>WEDDING OF THE OPERAS</h2>

<p>Each guest was given a double card or booklet with
pencil attached, the cover representing a miniature sheet
of music. Upon one page was a list of numbered questions,

committee should wear a large white ribbon rosette. Also
have a white ribbon quartet for the musical part of the program,
and have each one wear a large white ribbon bow on
the left breast. Have plenty of white flowers for decoration,
also use anything white that can be used in any way
to help decorate. Have a large bowl or white dish in
centre of dining-table with small white baby ribbons hanging
over the edge, one for each guest you expect. Tie to
the end of each ribbon a small slip of paper bearing instructions
as to what each one is to do. Each guest
is to pull out a slip, see what he is to do, and then proceed

<h2><a name="Act_181" id="Act_181"></a>WHY WE NEVER MARRIED</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Evening's Entertainment to be Given by Seven
Maids and Seven Bachelors</span></p>

<p class="center">(Copyright, 1899, by the Curtis Publishing Company and republished
by courtesy of the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>)</p>

<p>Although this entertainment is here planned to include
fourteen people, the number of those who take part in it
may, of course, be reduced to as few or increased to as
many as desired, either by omitting one or more of the
couples already provided for, or by including more couples
and composing additional verses for them.</p>

<p>The characters appear seated in a semicircle, a young
man first, then a young woman, and so on alternately, beginning
at the right as one faces the audience. Each one
is dressed in a fashion appropriate to the character represented.
Starting with the first young man at the right,
each advances in turn to the front and recites.</p>

<p>Number one says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Of all the girls that ever I knew,</p>
<p>I never saw one that I thought would do.</p>
<p>I wanted a wife that was nice and neat,</p>
<p>That was up to date, and that had small feet;</p>
<p>I wanted a wife that was loving and kind,</p>
<p>And that hadn't too much original mind;</p>
<p>I wanted a wife that could cook and sew,</p>
<p>And that wasn't eternally on the go;</p>
<p>I wanted a wife that just loved to keep house,</p>
<p>And that wasn't too timid to milk the cows;</p>
<p>I wanted a wife that was strikingly beautiful,</p>
<p>Intelligent, rich, and exceedingly dutiful.</p>
<p>That isn't so much to demand in a wife,</p>
<p>But still she's not found, though I've looked all my life."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Number two next recites:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The only reason why I've never wed</p>
<p>Is as clear as the day, and as easily said:</p>
<p>Two lovers I had who'd have made me a bride,</p>
<p>But the trouble was just that I couldn't decide;</p>
<p>Whenever John came I was sure it was he</p>
<p>That I cared for most; but with Charlie by me,</p>
<p>My hands clasped in his, and his eyes fixed on mine,</p>
<p>'Twas as easy as could be to say, 'I'll be thine.'</p>
<p>Now tell me what was a poor maiden to do,</p>
<p>Who couldn't, to save her, make choice 'tween the two?</p>
<p>I dillied and dallied, and couldn't decide,</p>
<p>Till John, he got married, and Charlie, he died;</p>
<p>And that is the reason why I've never wed;</p>
<p>For how could I help it, as every one said,</p>
<p>When John, he was married, and Charlie was dead."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Number three now speaks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I have never proposed to any girl.</p>
<p>Was I to be caught in the snare of a curl,</p>
<p>And dangle through life in a dizzy whirl?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Humph! I know too much for that by half!</p>
<p>I may look young, but I'm not a calf;</p>
<p>You can't catch a bird like me with chaff.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I know their tricks, I know their arts,</p>
<p>I know how they scheme to capture hearts;</p>
<p>I know they can play a dozen parts.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"How do I know so much, you ask?</p>
<p>To reply to that isn't much of a task;</p>
<p>For if you must know, O madams and misters,</p>
<p>I'm the only brother of fourteen sisters."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Number four advances and says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"My lovers came from near and far,</p>
<p class="i1">And sued before my feet;</p>
<p>They told me I was like a star;</p>
<p class="i1">They said that I was sweet;</p>
<p>And each one swore if I'd accept</p>
<p class="i1">His heart and eke his hand,</p>
<p>That he would be the happiest man</p>
<p class="i1">Throughout the whole broad land.</p>
<p>But one proud youth remained aloof,</p>
<p class="i1">And stood untouched, unmoved;</p>
<p>Oh, bitter fate! he was the one,</p>
<p class="i1">The only one I loved!</p>
<p>I tried on him each winning charm,</p>
<p class="i1">I put forth every art,</p>
<p>But all in vain; he turned away,</p>
<p class="i1">And took with him my heart.</p>
<p>This is the reason I am left</p>
<p class="i1">Alone upon the tree,</p>
<p>Like withered fruit, though not a pear;</p>
<p class="i1">Oh, would that I might be!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Number five recites these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The only reason why I've never married</p>
<p>Is because all my plans for proposing miscarried;</p>
<p>I wouldn't propose till all was propitious,</p>
<p>Till I felt pretty sure that the signs were auspicious.</p>
<p>More than once I've been moved to propound the fond query,</p>
<p>'Won't you tell me you love me, my beautiful dearie?'</p>
<p>When just at that moment came something or other,</p>
<p>A ring at the bell, or a call from her mother,</p>
<p>Or the sudden approach of her infantile brother,</p>
<p>My words to arrest, my intentions to smother;</p>
<p>And once, when a few leading questions I'd asked,</p>
<p>She laughed as if jokes in my questions were masked;</p>
<p>I couldn't conceive what had caused her commotion,</p>
<p>But 'twas so disconcerting I gave up the notion;</p>
<p>Although I felt certain as certain could be,</p>
<p>That whatever she laughed at, it was not at me."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Number six then says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"From my earliest years</p>

<p>That I was intended</p>
<p class="i1">To carry out a mission.</p>
<p>Whatever it might be</p>
<p class="i1">I hadn't the least notion,</p>
<p>But I searched for it faithfully</p>
<p class="i1">From ocean to ocean.</p>
<p>For a while I kept thinking</p>
<p class="i1">That I was surely meant</p>
<p>To preach to the heathen,</p>
<p class="i1">But I never was sent.</p>
<p>Then the surging thoughts and feelings</p>
<p class="i1">That upon me seemed to press</p>
<p>Surely proved beyond all question</p>
<p class="i1">That I was a poetess;</p>
<p>But the editors were cruel,</p>
<p class="i1">They were stonily unkind;</p>
<p>And their inappreciation</p>
<p class="i1">Drove the notion from my mind.</p>
<p>Now I'm sure that I'm a speaker;</p>
<p class="i1">'Tis my latest great impression;</p>
<p>And I'd like to prove it to you,</p>
<p class="i1">If I might without digression;</p>
<p>But whatever is my mission,</p>
<p class="i1">I've been certain all my life,</p>
<p>That 'tis something higher, nobler,</p>

</div></div>

<p>Number seven speaks thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>And then she said that I must go</p>
<p class="i1">And get her pa's consent.</p>
<p>Her pa, he was a mason rude,</p>
<p class="i1">Well used to handling bricks,</p>
<p>And when I came to talk with him</p>
<p class="i1">My courage went to sticks.</p>
<p>'K-kind sir, may I have M-Mary Jane?'</p>
<p class="i1">I asked with gasp and stutter;</p>
<p>Then came an earthquake, then a blank&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">I went home on a shutter.</p>
<p>I never married Mary Jane,</p>
<p class="i1">The maid whom I'd selected;</p>
<p>The reason was because her pa&mdash;</p>

<p>He thought that a woman ought always to do</p>
<p>Just what her husband wanted her to,</p>
<p>And I was as set and decided as he,</p>
<p>That that way of life would never suit me;</p>
<p>And so we kept wrangling all summer and fall,</p>
<p>And at last we agreed not to marry at all;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I've been in love with lots of girls,</p>
<p class="i1">A bachelor's life I hate;</p>
<p>I've all the time that I could want</p>
<p class="i1">To find and win a mate;</p>
<p>I've never come in contact with</p>
<p class="i1">A brick-objecting pa,</p>
<p>Or been deterred by brothers small</p>
<p class="i1">Or loudly calling ma;</p>
<p>I've never found it hard to choose</p>
<p class="i1">With whom I would be mated;</p>
<p>Oh, no, 'tis quite another cause&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">I'm not appreciated;</p>
<p>I've popped the question o'er and o'er,</p>
<p class="i1">But if you will believe me,</p>
<p>There wasn't one of all of them</p>
<p class="i1">That I could get to have me.</p>
<p>And that is why I'm left alone,</p>
<p class="i1">Now love's young dream is gone,</p>
<p>To darn my hose and mend my clo'es</p>
<p class="i1">And sew my buttons on."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then number fourteen says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"My friends have all told you the reason why they</p>
<p>Keep on in a lonesome, old-maidenly way,</p>
<p>Without any husband to lighten their loads,</p>
<p>Without any helper to smooth the rough roads;</p>
<p>I, too, am unmarried, but not for the causes</p>
<p>That they have all stated in rhythmical clauses:</p>
<div class="poem i4 s95">
<p>My lover didn't die,</p>
<p class="i1">And he never went away;</p>
<p>My father didn't stand</p>
<p class="i1">A moment in my way;</p>
<p>I've never quarreled once,</p>
<p class="i1">Nor been bothered to decide,</p>
<p>But I've got a first-class reason</p>
<p class="i1">Why I've never been a bride;</p>
<p>At any kind of mission</p>
<p class="i1">I wouldn't even glance;</p>
<p>The simple truth is this&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">I've never had a chance;</p>
<p>Other folks, I s'pose, have had 'em,</p>
<p class="i1">But they've never come to me;</p>
<p>Though I don't see why they shouldn't,</p>
<p class="i1">For I'm willing as can be;</p>
<p>And all I've got to say is,</p>
<p class="i1">And I say it frank and free,</p>
<p>If you think I won't get married,</p>
<p class="i1">Just you question me and see."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the close of number fourteen's recitation, all rise and
stand in two rows, facing each other, the ladies in one row
and the gentlemen in the other. The gentlemen then recite
in concert as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Since we all are yet unmated,</p>
<p class="i1">And are getting on in years,</p>
<p>Why not now decide the matter</p>
<p class="i1">By dividing up in pairs?</p>
<p>If I ask you to accept me,</p>
<p class="i1">And my lonely life to bless,</p>
<p>Will you? Will you? Will you?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Ladies in chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Yes!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Each lady takes the arm of the gentleman facing her,
and all walk off to the music of the wedding march.</p>

<h2><a name="Act_182" id="Act_182"></a>WIFE OF SANTA CLAUS</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">An Entertainment for the Sunday-School</span></p>

<p>The Sunday-school, school or club is assembled; the
stage is concealed by a curtain, and the Christmas tree,
which is near the stage, by another curtain or screen.
The tree is decorated in the usual manner, minus the gifts,
which are concealed near the stage ready to be delivered
when the right time comes. The tree need not be lighted
until the closing of any preliminary exercises that have
been arranged. After lighting, the tree should be exposed
to the view of all. When the children have gazed at it
for a few moments, the superintendent or some other suitable
person should come forward, as if to distribute the
gifts as usual. He should survey the tree attentively and
from different standpoints, and finally, with great astonishment,
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Why, what in the world does this mean? What
strange thing is this? What is the matter with my eyes?
[<i>Rubbing his eyes to see better.</i>] I can't see! As true as
I live, I cannot see a single Christmas gift upon this tree!
Think of it, a Christmas tree with no presents! Am I
growing blind? [<i>Rubbing his eyes again.</i>]</p>

<p>"Do you see any? [<i>Turning to any child near.</i>]
Well, I thought so! It is too true, children, that although
we have a Christmas tree, and a fine one, too, there is not
a single gift upon it; no, not even a little one for a little
bit of a girl! Now, this is altogether too bad of Santa
Claus to forget this Sunday-school&mdash;when we've gotten all
ready for him, too, lighted the tree and decorated it so
beautifully! It isn't a bit like him, either. He never did
such a thing before. He can't have forgotten us. The
blessed old Saint wouldn't do that! Maybe his reindeer
are lame and he is slow in getting here. No! He would
have sent Jack Frost on ahead to tell us to wait. Let me
think a moment. It can't be that any of you children
have been so naughty that he thinks we don't deserve a
visit from him, can it? No, no, that cannot be; it is a
mistake, somehow. It is very mysterious; I never heard of
the like before&mdash;no, never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do about it, anyway?
Can't some one speak up and explain this mystery, or at
least tell us what to do to celebrate Christmas?"</p>

<p>At this juncture the sound of sleigh-bells is heard at the
back or side of the stage, and a loud "Whoa!" and a
shrill whistle. There is an instant of bustling, crunching
of ice, stamping and pawing of feet, then the door bursts
open suddenly, as if by a gust of wind, and a nimble little
fellow bounces in, clad all in red and flecked with tufts of
cotton on cap and shoulders to look like snow. He wears
a high, peaked cap of red with a bobbing tassel on the
peak, and carries a long thong whip, which he flourishes in
time to the rhyme he chants:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ho for us! hey for us!</p>
<p>Please clear the way for us!</p>
<p>I'm Jack Frost from Icicle-land,</p>
<p>Driver of Santa's four-in-hand;</p>
<p>Though late you will ask no excuse."</p>
</div></div>

<p>With a flourish he draws back the curtain, announcing
"Mrs. Santa Claus!" There, with a mammoth pumpkin
standing by her side, is seen a beaming-faced little fat
woman. She is dressed in a fur cloak, or fur-lined circular
turned wrong side out, an ermine poke bonnet, made of
white cotton-wool, with black worsted tails, and an immense
muff of the same. She steps forward, and in a
dramatic style delivers this address:</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa Claus's Address</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Good-evening to you, children dear;</p>
<p class="i1">I know you cannot guess</p>
<p>The reason I am here to-night,</p>
<p class="i1">And so I'll just confess</p>
<p>That I am Mrs. Santa Claus&mdash;</p>
<p class="i1">Old Santa Claus's wife;</p>
<p>You've never seen me here before,</p>
<p class="i1">I'm sure, in all your life.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"So if you'll listen patiently,</p>
<p class="i1">I'll tell the reason why</p>
<p>Old Santa could not come to-night,</p>
<p class="i1">And why instead came I;</p>
<p>He is so very busy now,</p>
<p class="i1">Has so many schools&mdash;you see</p>
<p>He can't find time to visit all,</p>
<p class="i1">And deck each Christmas tree.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>"And so he said unto his wife:</p>
<p class="i1">'My faithful partner dear,</p>
<p>That Sunday-school's expecting me</p>
<p class="i1">To help keep Christmas cheer;</p>
<p>As I can't possibly reach there,</p>
<p class="i1">I'm disappointed quite;</p>
<p>I know that they will look for me</p>
<p class="i1">With shining eyes so bright!'</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I, Mrs. Santa, thus replied:</p>
<p class="i1">'Please let your better-half</p>
<p>Go visit that nice Sunday-school;</p>
<p class="i1">'Twill make the children laugh.'</p>
<p>This plan just suited Santa Claus;</p>
<p class="i1">He sent Jack Frost to drive;</p>
<p>He knew what fun 'twould be for me</p>
<p class="i1">Among you thus to arrive!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"And so, lest him you should forget,</p>
<p class="i1">That blessed, dear old fellow</p>
<p>The queerest Christmas gift sends you,</p>
<p class="i1">This pumpkin, big and yellow;</p>
<p>He hopes that when you cut it up</p>
<p class="i1">You'll quite delighted be,</p>
<p>To find the inside quite different</p>
<p class="i1">From what you're used to see.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Now if the shell is not too hard</p>
<p class="i1">I'll cut it open wide,</p>
<p>That you may see with your own eyes</p>
<p class="i1">This curious inside. [<i>She cuts it open.</i>]</p>
<p>Ah, yes! we've found the inside now,</p>
<p class="i1">And so present to view</p>
<p>This fairy, who, from Wonderland,</p>
<p class="i1">Has come to visit you."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The fairy, a little girl dressed in white, with a wand,
and wings, if possible, skips out of the pumpkin and sings:</p>

<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">Fairy's Song</span><br />

(Tune, "Little Buttercup")</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"Yes I am a fairy, a genuine fairy,</p>
<p class="i1">And if you cannot tell why</p>
<p>I've come in this pumpkin, this big yellow pumpkin,</p>
<p class="i1">The reason to guess you may try.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I bring you sweet tokens, yes, many fond tokens,</p>
<p class="i1">Of love and sweet friendship true;</p>
<p>From sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers,</p>
<p class="i1">And many dear friends who love you.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"So here are your presents, your own Christmas presents,</p>
<p class="i1">With which you may now deck your tree,</p>
<p>So please to remember the bright Christmas fairy,</p>
<p class="i1">The bright Christmas fairy you see.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"I wish you 'Merry Christmas,' a real merry Christmas,</p>
<p class="i1">And also a 'Happy New-Year;'</p>
<p>If you love one another, each sister and brother,</p>
<p class="i1">No harm from the fairies you'll fear."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The gifts are then distributed by the fairy, who appears
to take them from the inside of the pumpkin. Unless the
children are too small, and likely to be timid, they should
go forward to receive their gifts when their names are called
by the fairy, who apparently knows them all by name,
but who is prompted by some one reading from a list
standing behind the curtain close by her side. Jack Frost
whisks about helping the fairy hand out the gifts and assisting
the wee ones to get down off the stage with their
bundles. During Mrs. Santa's address he might carelessly
perch himself upon the pumpkin.</p>

<p>The pumpkin is made with a strong wire frame (can be
made at any hardware store), and covered with a deep yellow
cambric with an occasional green smutch painted upon
it. It is in two hemispheres and is tied together strongly
at the bottom and loosely at the top, so that the fairy inside
can easily loosen the top string and step out when
Mrs. Santa cuts open the pumpkin with a large carving-knife.</p>

<p>In case it is not practicable to have a pumpkin-frame
made, substitute for it a gigantic snowball made of cotton-wool,
covered with diamond-dust to sparkle like snow-crystals.
Two large old-fashioned umbrellas that are dome-shaped
will serve very nicely for the frame of a spherical
ball, if the tips of the ribs are wired together. It should
then be covered inside and outside with white cloth on
which the cotton batting can be basted. With such an arrangement
it would be necessary to dispense with the fairy,
but the little folks might have the surprise of seeing the
snowball slowly open at a snap from Jack Frost's whip,
disclosing a nest of smaller snowballs. These Jack Frost
might toss to the children and, when opened, they might
be found to contain candy and nuts.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
